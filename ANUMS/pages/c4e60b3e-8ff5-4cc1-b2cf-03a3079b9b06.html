         <p>With the war&#8217;s end, Joe Moyal was poised to enter another life. His
            reputation at De Havilland&#8217;s had continued to rise and he was offered the
            job of developing a guidance system for the &#8216;Black Knight&#8217; missile which
            would combine a mixture of the electronic and electrical engineering which,
            as he put it, he had &#8216;exploited during the war&#8217;. But he had had enough of
            the technology of warfare. &#8216;I was sick of war and research on war&#8217;, he
            reflected later, and he was anxious to make revisions and headway on his
              quantum paper and extend his research in mathematics, physics and
              statistics.<a id="d0e1585" class="indexterm"></a></p>
         <p>His intellectual circle, moreover, was widening and moving him into
              congenial fields. His wartime contacts included his supportive Cambridge
              contacts, Maurice Bartlett and Dr. Harold Jeffries and, via Professor
              Fowler, other members of the Department of Mathematics.<a id="d0e1590" class="indexterm"></a><a id="d0e1593" class="indexterm"></a><a id="d0e1596" class="indexterm"></a></p>

         <p>Maurice Bartlett was destined to become one of Britain&#8217;s major
              statisticians. A scholarship boy at Queen&#8217;s College, Cambridge, he had taken
              his first degree in mathematics, soaked up courses on statistical mechanics
              with Ralph Fowler and statistical sources with Colin Clark, studied quantum
              mechanics with Paul Dirac, and launched into early research in mathematical
              statistics in his fourth year, publishing his first papers as a student.
              Graduating in 1933, he became an assistant lecturer in the new Statistics
              Department at University College, London, where he worked (among others)
              with the new Galton Professor, R.A. Fisher. Eager, however, to come to grips
              with the practice and application of statistics, he moved the following year
              to become a statistician at Imperial Chemical Industries Agricultural
              Research Station at Jealotts Hill, Berkshire. In 1938 he transferred to a
              lectureship at Cambridge and, as the &#8216;phoney war&#8217; ended in 1940, he was
              allocated to a Ministry of Supply establishment devoted to rocket research
              first in Kent and later London.<a id="d0e1615" class="indexterm"></a><a id="d0e1618" class="indexterm"></a><a id="d0e1621" class="indexterm"></a><a id="d0e1624" class="indexterm"></a><a id="d0e1627" class="indexterm"></a></p>
         <p>Joe met him sometime during 1940-1. Born the same year in 1910, their
              meeting struck sparks; Joe the lively, mathematically talented engineer and
              Maurice, the shy, clever offspring of humble parents, whose interest in
              probabilistic physics had taken early root. In his autobiographical essay,
              &#8216;Chance and Change&#8217;, Bartlett recalls:<a id="d0e1632" class="indexterm"></a><a id="d0e1635" class="indexterm"></a></p>
         <p>&#8216;It was during the war years I first met J. E. Moyal, through our
              mutual interests rather than by chance encounter. I had as part of my
              general interest in the role of probabilistic ideas in statistical physics,
              always been puzzled by the anomalous way in which probability had slipped
              into the new wave mechanics, not fundamentally but as an interpretation of
              the positive measure <span class="emphasis"><em>&#968; &#968;*,</em></span> where <span class="emphasis"><em>&#968;</em></span>
              is the wave function. I heard, I think through J. O. Irwin (who was in
              Cambridge at the time), that Moyal, who had previously been in France, had
              been working on this problem; and this was to be the start of a long
              association between us.&#8217;<a id="d0e1646" class="indexterm"></a><sup class="footnoteNumber">[<a id="d0e1649" href="#ftn.d0e1649">1</a>]</sup></p>
         <p>Bartlett was immediately struck by Joe&#8217;s knowledge of European work.
              Progress with &#8216;the wave or quantum-mechanical problem&#8217;, he acknowledged, was
              slow and limited in Britain where &#8216;English statisticians for a long time had
              tended to believe that a traditional empiricism exonerated them from
              overmuch study of abstract continental mathematics&#8217;. He found Joe well
              acquainted with A.N. Kolmogorov&#8217;s fundamental work published in German in
              1933 and Khinchine&#8217;s writings, and, as he put it, &#8216;Moyal&#8217;s more general
              knowledge of European work in the theory of stochastic processes was a
              considerable stimulus to me&#8217;.<a id="d0e1664" class="indexterm"></a><a id="d0e1667" class="indexterm"></a></p>
         <p>During 1943-4 the two corresponded extensively and it was Bartlett&#8217;s
              interest and advice, as noted in Chapter 3, that encouraged Joe to discuss
              his evolving ideas on statistics and quantum mechanics with Fowler and
              Jeffreys, and hence to renew his original overture to Dirac. Clearly,
              Bartlett&#8217;s role proved highly sustaining to Joe in his prolonged struggle
              with the high priest of physics and steered him to further contact with
              Fowler as his paper grew.<a id="d0e1672" class="indexterm"></a><a id="d0e1675" class="indexterm"></a><a id="d0e1678" class="indexterm"></a></p>
         <p>&#8216;I do not think I told you about my meeting with Fowler&#8217;, Joe wrote
              Bartlett on 27 June 1944. &#8216;What he finally suggested was that the parts of
              my paper not dealing with quantum theory should appear in the form of a
              book. Professor Hardy<a id="d0e1683" class="indexterm"></a><a id="d0e1686" class="indexterm"></a><a id="d0e1689" class="indexterm"></a><sup class="footnoteNumber">[<a id="d0e1692" href="#ftn.d0e1692">2</a>]</sup> and the Cambridge Press have now accepted it for publication
              as a monograph of 200 pages.&#8217;<sup class="footnoteNumber">[<a id="d0e1700" href="#ftn.d0e1700">3</a>]</sup> Since Joe saw that this required an additional overview of all
              the relevant work already done on stochastic processes, he suggested a
              collaboration with Bartlett, a project which they mutually agreed to in
              1946. Significantly then, while Dirac demurred over Joe&#8217;s originality in his
              statistical research, the distinguished Professors Hardy and Fowler were
              urging it into major print.<a id="d0e1711" class="indexterm"></a><a id="d0e1714" class="indexterm"></a><a id="d0e1717" class="indexterm"></a><a id="d0e1720" class="indexterm"></a></p>
         <p>A second valuable contact Joe made from De Havilland was with Sidney
              Goldstein who was destined to become an important academic colleague and
              friend. During the thirties, Goldstein was a Fellow of St. John&#8217;s College,
              Cambridge, and lecturer in Mathematics. A man of diverse parts, he was also
              the acclaimed editor of the collective work, <a id="d0e1725" class="indexterm"></a><a id="d0e1728" class="indexterm"></a><span class="emphasis"><em>Modern Developments in Fluid Dynamics</em></span>
              (1938), and a brilliant researcher and writer on aerodynamics, turbulence
              and the intricacies of the mechanics of fluids. At war&#8217;s outbreak, he was
              seconded from Cambridge to build up a key group concerned with advanced
              research in aerodynamics and its applications, and it was in this role that
              he was in touch with Joe at De Havilland to discuss questions of Joe&#8217;s work
              on turbulence.<a id="d0e1734" class="indexterm"></a></p>
         <p>Hence in the course of the war years, Joe Moyal had managed to
              penetrate the academic community and he knew for certain what he wanted to
              do. Yet his passage to an active participation in science-based research was
              irregular and followed an independent route. Coming as he did from a
              secondary education in a country remote from science&#8217;s established tracks,
              he had made his own way through advanced statistical, mathematical and
              physics training, but he lacked the personal and institutional mentoring
              that, traditionally, guides and supports the gifted researcher in an
              academic career.
         </p>
         <p>His chance, however, came late in 1946 with an opening in the
              Department of Mathematical Physics at The Queen&#8217;s University, Belfast. By
              then he had amassed a mixed but original collection of published scientific
              papers and some distinguished referees, and was appointed as Assistant
              Lecturer in Mathematics.
         </p>
         <p>His departmental head was P.P. Ewald, the Professor of Physics. Ewald
              himself was a man of considerable distinction. German-born, a pioneer of the
              study of crystals by X-Ray diffraction, he had taught for sixteen years at
              Stuttgart University where he was a colleague and friend of Schr&ouml;dinger.
              During 1937 - one of the many who fled the great centres of German physics -
              he left Stuttgart with his Jewish wife, declining to endorse &#8216;German
              physics&#8217; and its rejection of &#8216;Jewish relativity&#8217;, and accepted a
              lectureship in physics at The Queen&#8217;s University where he was appointed
              Professor in 1945. Recognizing Joe&#8217;s ability, he promoted him rapidly to a
              lectureship.<a id="d0e1743" class="indexterm"></a><a id="d0e1746" class="indexterm"></a></p>
         <p>This period at Queen&#8217;s proved a vital academic launch-pad for Joe,
              introducing him to undergraduate teaching and course development and
              offering a congenial friendship with Ewald, whose interests embraced the
              interplay between mathematical formalism and physical phenomena. During his
              two years there he took the opportunity to visit the famous Dublin Institute
              of Advanced Studies in Merriot Square, Dublin, which Ireland&#8217;s Prime
              Minister, Eamon de Valera (himself a former Professor of Mathematics) had
              established early in the war as a research centre for Mathematical Physics
              and Celtic Studies and to provide a safe harbour for Erwin Schr&ouml;dinger and
              other eminent scientific refugees from Europe. If Joe met the famous
              Schr&ouml;dinger on this visit, he left no formal account of it.<a id="d0e1751" class="indexterm"></a><a id="d0e1754" class="indexterm"></a></p>
         <p>The Queen&#8217;s University gave Joe a timely foot in the academic door and
              it was from there that he completed and submitted his paper on &#8216;Quantum
              Mechanics as a Statistical Theory&#8217; for publication. Late in 1948, however,
              his star ascending, he moved to a lectureship in Mathematical Statistics in
              the Department of Mathematics at Manchester University where Maurice
              Bartlett had been appointed to the founding Chair of Mathematical Statistics
              and director of the new Statistical Laboratory the previous year. For Joe
              this marked a move to the heart of leading edge statistics and applied
              mathematics in Britain.<a id="d0e1759" class="indexterm"></a></p>
         <p>Manchester University enjoyed a particularly high reputation in
              science. Its professoriate contained a remarkable coterie of men who had
              played outstanding roles in national scientific projects in World War II.
              Its senior Professor of Physics, P.M. Blackett FRS (later Lord Blackett),
              belonged to the glittering cluster of young graduates at Cambridge in the
              physical sciences in the early 1920s which brought together such luminaries
              as Chadwick, Kapitza and Fowler, and rose to fame in 1933 when he confirmed
              the existence of the positron. He had filled the W.L. Bragg Chair of Physics
              at Manchester from 1937 and throughout the war had served on Britain&#8217;s Air
              Defence Committee where he was a key player in developing the technique of
              operational research. In 1948 he won the Nobel Prize for Physics for his
              work on particle disintegration and cosmic rays. In Mathematics there was
              Max Newman and Sidney Goldstein, both Fellows of the Royal Society,
              recruited from Cambridge at the war&#8217;s end and appointed respectively as
              Professor of Mathematics and Head of the Department of Mathematics, and
              Professor of Applied Mathematics. Together these two colleagues were bent on
              building a new internationally renowned and dynamic Department of
              Mathematics which integrated pure and applied mathematics and extended their
              applications.<a id="d0e1764" class="indexterm"></a><a id="d0e1767" class="indexterm"></a><a id="d0e1770" class="indexterm"></a><a id="d0e1773" class="indexterm"></a><a id="d0e1776" class="indexterm"></a><a id="d0e1779" class="indexterm"></a></p>
         <p>Newman and Goldstein&#8217;s scientific wartime experience (like Blackett&#8217;s)
              gave a particular width of vision to this generation of men. Newman, a
              former university lecturer at Cambridge, teaching mathematics and conducting
              pioneer work on modern topology, had worked at Britain&#8217;s secret
              code-breaking centre, Bletchley Park. There he turned statistics to
              practical use by means of specially designed high-speed machines which both
              contributed to British success in deciphering German messages and ushered in
              an early development in electronic computing. At Manchester he fostered
              Britain&#8217;s first two computers and added the famous wartime code-breaker,
              A.M. Turing (and his &#8216;Turing machines&#8217;) to his staff. Newman was known as a
              shrewd judge of mathematicians and his administrative style shaped a
              hard-working and harmonious department.<a id="d0e1784" class="indexterm"></a><a id="d0e1787" class="indexterm"></a><a id="d0e1790" class="indexterm"></a><a id="d0e1793" class="indexterm"></a><sup class="footnoteNumber">[<a id="d0e1796" href="#ftn.d0e1796">4</a>]</sup></p>
         <p>Sidney Goldstein, for his part, was a luminous scholar with the gift
              for fostering talent and, in his aeronautical work at the Royal Aircraft
              Establishment, he had gathered a notable group of brilliant young
              researchers, one of whom, James Lighthill, he would bring to Manchester to
              succeed him late in 1950. Installed in the Department of Mathematics,
              Goldstein built a Fluid Motion Laboratory (the Barton Laboratory, later
              renamed the Goldstein Aeronautical Engineering Research Laboratory in his
              honour) on the outskirts of the city where experiments with supersonic wind
              tunnels and other facilities brought great benefit to theoretical discussion
              and developments at the university.<a id="d0e1808" class="indexterm"></a><sup class="footnoteNumber">[<a id="d0e1811" href="#ftn.d0e1811">5</a>]</sup></p>
         <p>Joe&#8217;s transfer to this stimulating environment brought him enormous
              gain. Here his &#8216;Quantum mechanics as a statistical theory&#8217; moved into early
              circulation and the terms &#8216;Wigner-Moyal formalism&#8217;, &#8216;Moyal bracket&#8217; and the
              &#8216;Moyal product&#8217; began to pass into the language of quantum physics. The
              Bartlett/Moyal paper, &#8216;The exact transition probability of quantum
              mechanical oscillators calculated by the phase-space method&#8217;, was also
              published during 1949. In the same period he worked up other substantial
              material from his original quantum document to participate with Bartlett and
              David Kendall in a ground-breaking Symposium of the Royal Statistical
              Society on Stochastic Processes. His &#8216;Stochastic processes and statistical
              physics&#8217; was published in the Society&#8217;s Journal that year. As Joe Gani
              summed up the papers from this pioneering Symposium, &#8216;To many students and
              researchers, these three important symposium papers opened up new and
              important vistas of research.&#8217;<a id="d0e1822" class="indexterm"></a><a id="d0e1825" class="indexterm"></a><a id="d0e1828" class="indexterm"></a><a id="d0e1831" class="indexterm"></a><a id="d0e1834" class="indexterm"></a><sup class="footnoteNumber">[<a id="d0e1837" href="#ftn.d0e1837">6</a>]</sup></p>
         <p>During this productive year, Joe also brought into print two other
              diverse papers, a lucid, generalist paper, &#8216;Causality, Determinism, and
              Probability&#8217;, and &#8216;The distribution of wars in time&#8217; which commanded some
              attention in the <span class="emphasis"><em>Journal of the Royal Statistical
                    Society.</em></span> The first was &#8216;just a pot boiler&#8217;, he said. &#8216;The work
              I&#8217;d done on stochastic processes got me interested in the general problem of
              the relation between causation and probability theory and this was just a
              set of remarks on the subject - a philosophical disquisition which I sent to
              the journal <span class="emphasis"><em>Philosophy</em></span>. I was amazed that it was
              promptly published!&#8217;<sup class="footnoteNumber">[<a id="d0e1858" href="#ftn.d0e1858">7</a>]</sup></p>
         <p>In this lively interdisciplinary arena, he was promoted in 1950 to
              Senior Lecturer. Goldstein sought him out to give a series of seminar
              lectures on the statistical theory of turbulence then attracting attention
              from the work of Russian mathematicians. For this Joe examined the new
              literature including that of Batchelor and Taylor in England. &#8216;I tried&#8217;, he
              said,<a id="d0e1867" class="indexterm"></a><sup class="footnoteNumber">[<a id="d0e1870" href="#ftn.d0e1870">8</a>]</sup> &#8216;to generalize the existing theory because like the rest of
              hydrodynamics or aerodynamics in those days the theory was developed on the
              assumption that fluids were incompressible which was an unrealistic
              assumption. So I introduced the turbulence terms, the pressure terms, and
              worked out the consequences where it wasn&#8217;t difficult to see that the terms
              involving pressure were comparatively small but they were certainly not
              zero. I advanced a hypothesis that the noise which is produced by turbulence
              flow of jet engines (then becoming important as people wanted to abate noise
              produced by big jet engines) was due to these neglected terms which coupled
              the shear waves of turbulence to the compression waves in the fluid&#8217;. His
              paper, &#8216;The spectra of turbulence in a compressible fluid: eddy turbulence
              and random noise&#8217;, appeared in 1952.

         <p>In the vital field of stochastic processes, Bartlett and Moyal
              cherished their larger collaborative plan. Despite advances in the study and
              use of statistical methods and their application in biology and other
              sciences, begun in the nineteenth century by Francis Galton and Karl Pearson
              and culminating at Cambridge in the twentieth century in the work of R. A.
              Fisher, theoretical work in stochastic processes was limited to a few
              specialized monographs, and there was no general work on which students and
              researchers could build. From 1946, the two prepared to produce a general
              book presenting the general theory of stochastic processes with special
              reference to its uses and applications in physics and statistics.<a id="d0e1877" class="indexterm"></a><a id="d0e1880" class="indexterm"></a><a id="d0e1883" class="indexterm"></a><a id="d0e1886" class="indexterm"></a></p>
         <p>Their decision to split the work into two parts &#8212; Joe building on the
              original manuscript Professor Hardy and the Cambridge University Press had
              accepted for publication on the basic mathematical theory, while Bartlett
              dealt with an introductory discussion of mathematical methods and
              statistical techniques &#8212; held fire. While Joe achieved `near completion&#8217; of
              his part, Bartlett was eager for print and it was agreed that he should
              publish his section based on some earlier lectures, as <a id="d0e1891" class="indexterm"></a><a id="d0e1894" class="indexterm"></a><span class="emphasis"><em>An Introduction to Stochastic Processes With special
                    reference to its Methods and Applications</em></span>, which appeared in
              1955. Bartlett&#8217;s pioneering volume made frequent reference to Joe&#8217;s work on
              mathematical theory as &#8216;M&#8217;. But while Joe drew material from it for his
              ongoing papers (always keener on new ideas than writing them up), he left
              his book on one side and this early foundation composition remained in
              manuscript form.<a id="d0e1900" class="indexterm"></a><sup class="footnoteNumber">[<a id="d0e1903" href="#ftn.d0e1903">9</a>]</sup> Hence `M&#8217; disappeared from the many subsequent editions of
              Bartlett&#8217;s successful book and his hope that Joe would author a third volume
              on a systematic discussion of stochastic processes in physics remained a
              pipe dream.<a id="d0e1917" class="indexterm"></a></p>
         <p>Joe&#8217;s lapse over the collaborative project would earn him the
              reputation of being a perfectionist, &#8216;one of those researchers who are very
              reluctant to publish anything until they have done everything,&#8217;<sup class="footnoteNumber">[<a id="d0e1922" href="#ftn.d0e1922">10</a>]</sup> a view confirmed by the fact that, while his output of
              published papers was by no means huge, all were substantial and
              characteristically thorough and complete.
         </p>
         <p>With the book in abeyance, Joe&#8217;s research at Manchester turned to the
              application of the theory of stochastic processes to physical problems such
              as neutron diffusion and multiplication and cascades. During 1950 he
              published a lengthy study, &#8216;The momentum and sign of fast cosmic ray
              particles&#8217;, and, among others, prepared &#8216;Statistical Problems in Nuclear and
              Cosmic Ray Physics&#8217; as an invited paper for the Proceedings of the 29th
              Session of the International Statistical Institute, Rio de Janeiro, in 1955.
              His 'Theory of ionization fluctuations&#8217; and &#8216;Theory of the ionization
              cascade&#8217; appeared within a further year.
         </p>
         <p>Postgraduate students from overseas flocked to Manchester&#8217;s Department
              of Mathematics. Alladi Ramakrishnan, having studied cosmic ray showers with
              Professor Bhabha at the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research in Bombay,
              came to work on the theory of point processes and was supervised by Joe and
              Bartlett. Another Indian student, Uma Prabhu, whom he was supervising, was
              passed on happily (as Joe departed on a visit overseas) to a surprised
              newly-arrived `postdoc&#8217;, Dr. Joe Gani (whom Joe had encouraged to come to
              Manchester from The Australian National University), with the buoyant words,
              `You&#8217;ll be alright, Joe. You can do it!&#8217;<a id="d0e1937" class="indexterm"></a><a id="d0e1940" class="indexterm"></a><a id="d0e1943" class="indexterm"></a><a id="d0e1946" class="indexterm"></a><sup class="footnoteNumber">[<a id="d0e1949" href="#ftn.d0e1949">11</a>]</sup> Prabhu flourished and later became Professor in Operations
              Research and Industrial Engineering at Cornell University.<a id="d0e1957" class="indexterm"></a></p>
         <p>Among the undergraduate students drawn from Manchester and its
              surrounding region, often from families with scant acquaintance with
              university careers, Joe taught several young women who showed great promise
              in mathematics only to find, to his chagrin, that they subjugated their
              research promise to marry mathematicians of lesser skill.
              Characteristically, throughout his career, he sought to help and encourage
              women in his fields.
         </p>
         <p>In addition to its scientific abundance, Manchester University offered
              a rich social milieu. Many of the science professors were Jewish: Goldstein,
              Newman, Bernhard Neumann, a refugee in the thirties from Germany now engaged
              (after challenging times) on group theory at Manchester,<a id="d0e1964" class="indexterm"></a><a id="d0e1967" class="indexterm"></a><a id="d0e1970" class="indexterm"></a><sup class="footnoteNumber">[<a id="d0e1973" href="#ftn.d0e1973">12</a>]</sup> and Harold Ruben, a fellow Senior Lecturer in mathematics and
              statistics. In addition, crossing cultures, there was the renowned
              political, diplomatic and parliamentary historian, Lewis Namier, who had
              held the Chair of Modern History at Manchester since 1931.<a id="d0e1981" class="indexterm"></a><a id="d0e1984" class="indexterm"></a></p>
         <p>Namier had been Political Secretary of the Jewish Agency for Palestine
              for two years before his appointment to the University. Closely allied with
              Chaim Weizmann and now within a few years of retirement, the voluble
              historian enjoyed the company of the mathematical Israeli. He also picked
              his brains. A one-time businessman in the twenties, Namier frequently sought
              Joe&#8217;s advice, as a probabilist and rising expert in a discipline with its
              origins in games of chance, on a mathematical system to &#8216;break the Bank at
              Monte Carlo!&#8217;<a id="d0e1989" class="indexterm"></a><a id="d0e1992" class="indexterm"></a></p>
         <p>While the Jewish presence at the university was rich and energizing,
              anti-Semitism was not unknown in the town. Joe and his family, now added to
              in wartime by a son, David, made their home in a village outside Manchester
              where Joe developed warm friendships with the Unitarian clergyman and other
              neighbours. But hearing one day that his daughter, Orah, had been publicly
              described in a school class - in those recent post-holocaust days - as &#8216;a
              dirty Jew&#8217;, he arrived at the teacher&#8217;s door with a whip.<a id="d0e1997" class="indexterm"></a><a id="d0e2000" class="indexterm"></a></p>
         <p>His contact with Namier, and his close friendship with Goldstein, a
              committed British-born Zionist, who had also imbibed his passion for the
              Jewish State at the feet of Chaim Weizmann and who would take up the joint
              posts of Professor of Applied Mathematics and Vice-President of the Technion
              Institute of Technology in Haifa late in 1950, no doubt stimulated Joe&#8217;s own
              thoughts about the possibility of returning as an academic to his own
              country which had become the State of Israel in 1948.<a id="d0e2005" class="indexterm"></a><a id="d0e2008" class="indexterm"></a><a id="d0e2011" class="indexterm"></a></p>
         <p>Memories of the land of his youth ran deeply in his psyche. Could he
              now contribute professionally to its development? He hoped he might and
              during the university vacation of 1951, he paid a brief visit to Israel.
              There he renewed links with old friends; but he also made contact with the
              new Weizmann Institute of Science which, two years earlier, had been founded
              at the gateway of the desert at Rehovoth for the purpose of conducting
              fundamental research.<a id="d0e2016" class="indexterm"></a></p>
         <p>Weizmann, Israel&#8217;s first President and himself a distinguished
              scientist with a world reputation in organic chemistry, had long conceived a
              blueprint for the Institute as a national research centre that would
              contribute to the building of a new nation. However, it quickly appeared
              that, in an embattled country struggling to survive, pure research must be
              viewed in future terms and the early recruitment of scientists turned, not
              on well-established talent or highly original &#8216;home-grown&#8217; researchers, but
              on practical scientists imported from abroad. The Institute&#8217;s earliest
              appointments accordingly included an English infra-red spectroscopist, a
              Scottish and an American crystallographer, an Indian dye chemist in protein
              chemistry, and a well-qualified applied mathematician from the United
              States. This last recruit soon found that his Department of Applied
              Mathematics was little more than an &#8216;accommodation address&#8217; in which
              &#8216;muscular mathematicians&#8217; were the Institute&#8217;s choice in a land more needy
              of gravimetric surveys and seismic cross-sections than the applications of
              fundamental mathematics.<a id="d0e2021" class="indexterm"></a><sup class="footnoteNumber">[<a id="d0e2024" href="#ftn.d0e2024">13</a>]</sup></p>
         <p>Joe was deeply disappointed by this outcome. Indeed, his failure to be
              accepted in his own country as a `sabra&#8217; now making fundamental
              contributions to research in mathematics and physics abroad was a serious
              personal blow. He would follow Israel&#8217;s varied fortunes throughout his life;
              but he never visited his country again.
         </p>
         <p>At Manchester, however, his contribution to physics and probability
              were bringing him invitations to research centres around the world. During
              1954, he accepted one from Professor Harry Messel, Head of the School of
              Physics at the University of Sydney, and took up a six months Visiting
              Readership there in Theoretical Physics. Messel was a rising phenomenon in
              Australian science. The child of immigrant Ukrainian parents in Canada, he
              had roared through degrees and scholarships, grasped a Fellowship at St
              Andrews University, Scotland, and moved on to take his doctoral degree at
              the Dublin Institute of Advanced Studies under Professor Janossy and Erwin
              Schr&ouml;dinger, with the latter becoming his close friend. Vivid and
              flamboyant, Messel had come to Australia to a lectureship at the University
              of Adelaide, but, alerted to the opportunity of developing a great physics
              school, had quickly accepted the directorship of a major new School of
              Physics at the University of Sydney.<a id="d0e2038" class="indexterm"></a><a id="d0e2041" class="indexterm"></a></p>
         <p>There in the early 1950s, catching big brains and bringing in highly
              qualified Australians and distinguished scientists from Britain, the USA and
              Europe, he had made fourteen new permanent academic appointments and began
              to build a dynamic relationship between his School, the community, and
              industry. Through personal contacts and compelling entrepreneurship, he
              rolled in major funding for his Science Foundation for Physics which he
              created to staunch the brain drain of talented young Australian scientists
              overseas.

         <p>Messel had first met Joe after leaving the Dublin Institute when he
              called at Manchester University in 1951. Joe&#8217;s research was of interest to
              him and they talked of collaborative work. Though some twelve years Joe&#8217;s
              junior, Messel felt a deep rapport with him. &#8216;Joe and I were very close&#8217;, he
              recalled in interview. `He had an enormously brilliant mind; an absolute
              genius, magnificent to talk to, so knowledgeable. There was also a softness
              about him. He was a very quiet, modest man, always polite, and he had that
              little grin&#8217;. Distinctively different in style and character, &#8216;we got on
              like a house on fire&#8217;, said Messel, &#8216;We had a great regard for each
              other&#8217;.<a id="d0e2062" class="indexterm"></a><sup class="footnoteNumber">[<a id="d0e2065" href="#ftn.d0e2065">14</a>]</sup></p>
         <p>Joe arrived in Australia by ship in August 1954 and was at once struck
              by the egalitarian ambience reminiscent of his own country. The Sydney
              University janitor who appeared to help him with his trunk cheerfully joined
              him for a drink, and putting up at Wesley College, the Methodist college in
              the University grounds, he found to his amused surprise that resident staff
              members viewed him &#8216;as a font of knowledge!&#8217;.
         </p>
         <p>A step away, the shabby old Physics School with its long dark
              corridors, was alive with a brilliant group of researchers, &#8216;a
              new-for-Australia theoretical group&#8217; working on cosmic rays and cracking the
              code of the unusual behaviour of many substances at very low temperature.
              These included Dr Stuart Butler, Dr John Blatt and a Visiting Reader from
              Zurich who announced at the time a major breakthrough in the theory of
              superconductivity and superfluidity.<a id="d0e2076" class="indexterm"></a><a id="d0e2079" class="indexterm"></a><sup class="footnoteNumber">[<a id="d0e2082" href="#ftn.d0e2082">15</a>]</sup></p>
         <p>Joe&#8217;s months in this circle sowed the seeds of a strong professional
              and personal attachment to Australia and, in one of his subsequent papers,
              he acknowledged Harry Messel&#8217;s contribution to his thinking, together with
              Bartlett and David Kendall, all of whom &#8216;first interested me in point
              processes&#8217;.<a id="d0e2094" class="indexterm"></a><a id="d0e2097" class="indexterm"></a><a id="d0e2100" class="indexterm"></a><a id="d0e2103" class="indexterm"></a></p>
         <p>His second overseas visit took place in 1956 when he accepted a
              Visiting Professorship in the Department of Mathematical Statistics at
              Columbia University. On this occasion he joined Herbert Robbins, the
              Professor of Mathematics, a major contributor in statistical research and
              probability theory, and enjoyed his first taste of rigorous contact with
              American colleagues and the excitement of New York. In the summer of 1957,
              he was in the United States again, as Visiting Professor at the University
              of California, Berkeley, in the Department of Mathematical Statistics
              presided over by the legendary Professor Jerzy Neyman. There since 1949,
              this much-loved Polish founding father had organized and published the
              volumes of the <a id="d0e2108" class="indexterm"></a><a id="d0e2111" class="indexterm"></a><span class="emphasis"><em>Proceedings of the Berkeley Symposiums on
                    Mathematical Statistics and Probability</em></span> as a disciplinary four-yearly
              event and had, in the words of David Kendall, created a Statistical
              Laboratory in his Department &#8216;to which all statistical magnets now point&#8217;.
              It was a centre to which Joe, too, would often return.<a id="d0e2117" class="indexterm"></a><a id="d0e2120" class="indexterm"></a></p>
         <p>Between such visits, at home in Manchester Joe&#8217;s ranging mind
              ruminated on another fundamental paper, `Discontinuous Markoff processes,&#8217;
              published in <span class="emphasis"><em>Acta Mathematica </em></span>in 1957. Gani later wrote
              of this paper that it was `concerned with discontinuous Markov processes
              where the state of the system may change continuously or by sudden chance
              jumps. Such processes are specified by two functions: the probability of a
              transition without jumps, and the probability distribution of the first jump
              time and the consequent state of the process. The total transition
              probability depends on both of these functions. Whereas previous work had
              concentrated mainly on jump processes only, Moyal was able to generalize
              existing results and derive new ones for the mixed case, which he analysed
              with his usual thoroughness.&#8217;<a id="d0e2128" class="indexterm"></a><sup class="footnoteNumber">[<a id="d0e2131" href="#ftn.d0e2131">16</a>]</sup></p>
         <p>Joe&#8217;s capacity for significant overarching generalizations in
              probability and physics stemmed from a strong mix of creative imagination
              and a keenly analytical mathematical mind. `He represented to me&#8217;, Gani
              asserted in his Inaugural Lecture as Professor of Statistics at Sheffield
              University in 1966, `the pure mathematician&#8217;s approach to probability&#8217;. In
              this, Joe differed from his close colleague, Bartlett, who, grounded in
              classical statistics and deeply focussed in the discipline, was more
              `intuitive&#8217; in the approach he applied to a number.<a id="d0e2140" class="indexterm"></a><a id="d0e2143" class="indexterm"></a><sup class="footnoteNumber">[<a id="d0e2146" href="#ftn.d0e2146">17</a>]</sup></p>
         <p>Certainly during his nine years at Manchester University, Joe grasped
              the opportunity to reveal the unique range of his scientific ability,
              gaining reputation as a mathematician in quantum mechanics and a
              mathematical statistician and probabilist. In all three he had proved the
              power of mathematics, in Moshe Flato&#8217;s phrase, to &#8216;be endlessly
              interactive&#8217;.<a id="d0e2155" class="indexterm"></a><sup class="footnoteNumber">[<a id="d0e2158" href="#ftn.d0e2158">18</a>]</sup><sup></sup>Essentially, he had demonstrated his
              capacity to innovate and generalize and bring a statistical theory to bear
              in quantum mechanics that would yield powerful and diverse ideas, while his
              work on random functions and random processes in a number of physical fields
              would provide the backdrop for his subsequent groundbreaking research on
              stochastic population processes.
         </p>
         <p>Together with his diverse research, both at Manchester and Queen&#8217;s
              Universities and as a visitor in academia overseas, Joe developed and
              presented a range of undergraduate courses in mathematical statistics and
              mathematical physics including mechanics, hydrodynamics, and electromagnetic
              theory, and offered advanced courses on quantum theory, statistical
              mechanics, the theory of turbulence, the passage of atomic particles through
              matter, and the theory of stochastic processes and its applications. Always
              eager to incorporate new material, he performed best with graduate students
              where his method of working things out on the board and basing his lectures
              on his own research became a stimulating and challenging procedure.
         </p>
         <p>Received widely as a Visiting Professor overseas, it seemed by 1957
              that he had begun to set his sights beyond Manchester. His near decade at
              this premier University had proved invaluable. But now, his choice and
              decision formed to resign from the Department of Mathematics and accept a
              senior position in a country which was destined to become his major home
              base across the next 40 years.
