I have broad interests in the area of high performance
computing. Some of the projects we are currently working on include:<p>
    </tr></td><tr><td>
<UL>
  <LI><font size=2 color=#B060BF><b>Computer Architecture and Performance
      Modelling:</b></font><font size=2 color=black> Modern computer 
systems increasingly incorporate multi-core processors and have memory 
architectures that have non-uniform memory access. We are interested
in developing software tools and methods that are appropriate for such 
machines. This work is undertaken in partnership with Sun Microsystems 
and Gaussian Inc as part of Australian Research Council (ARC) Linkage Grant
LP0347178 (2002-2006). <br>

    Memory Placement on NUMA Architectures: Solaris
    and Linux, UltraSPARC/FirePlane and Opteron/HyperTransport",
    13th IEEE International Conference on High Performance Computing, 
    Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 338-352, 4297 (2006).
</font></ul>
<p>
  <LI><font  color=#B060BF><b>Cluster and Grid Computing:</b></font> Computers assembled from commodity
parts have revolutionised high performance computing. Much work
remains, however, to improved the usability and efficiency of these
systems. We are interested in developing queueing systems that can
optimally allocate user processes to heterogeneous cluster systems, and 
the use of virtualization to provide compute environments tailored for 
a given application. This work is in partnership with Alexander
Technology and is supported by ARC Linkage Grant LP0669726 (2006-2009)
<p>
  <LI><font color=#B060BF><b>Interval Arithmetic:</b></font> In contrast to computing with a single
machine representable floating point number, interval computations
define a range of floating point numbers between lower and 
upper bounds. We are using interval arithmetic to study the effects of
rounding and truncation errors for a variety of computational science
applications. We are also interested in a variety of novel interval
algorithms, such as the ability to rigorously determine global
minimums. This work is supported by ARC Discovery Grant 
DP0558228 (2005-2007).

Considerations", 2006 International Conference on Computational
Science, Lecture Notes in Computer Science 218-225, 3991 (2006)</font></ul>
<p>
  <LI><font color=#B060BF><b>Software Distributed Shared Memory:</b></font> The majority of computations 
performed on parallel systems use message passing models such as
MPI. MPI is often referred to as the assembly language of parallel
programming. We are interested in alternative approaches. Current work 
is focused on adapting shared memory parallel programming models, such 
as OpenMP to run on clusters.<br>

     Distributed Shared Memory Systems to Support OpenMP on Clusters"

</font></ul>

<p>
  <LI><font color=#B060BF><b>Intelligent Scientific Software:</b></font> Modern computing systems are
becoming increasing complex. Often the optimal computational algorithm 
will depend on the current runtime conditions. We are interested in
developing intelligent runtime environments that can be used with the
large body of existing scientific software. Current work is using
DynInst to perform dynamic code modification coupled with
reinforcement learning techniques to direct the code modification.

	Artifical Intelligence, Hobart, 4-8 December, 2006.</font></ul>

<p>
  <LI><font color=#B060BF><b>Computational Science:</b></font> We are
interested in the development and application of large scale
computational science applications. In current work we are studying
the cleaning of the Al2O3 surface using Ga. These calculations run for 
days on high performance computing platforms. Related work is
considering improved ways to generate fitting basis sets for
density functional calculations that use periodic boundary
conditions. <br>
