<p>Ahmad Farouk Musa and the organisation he leads, the Islamic Renaissance Front is at the forefront of promoting a vision of Islam that is progressive and democratic in Malaysia. His day job is as an academician at the Monash University, Malaysian Campus. He is a trained cardiothoracic surgeon and an ardent researcher who had presented his work across Asia and Europe. Apart from his academic and surgical world, he is actively involved in social work. He works for the promotion and establishment of civil society and has delivered talks related to Islam at universities and other Islamic centres in Malaysia. He had been involved in interfaith dialogues especially with regard to Christian-Muslim relations and also intra-faith dialogues especially the Shii-Sunni discourse. He writes for a column at the Islamic Party (PAS) official organ <a title="Harakahdaily" href="http://en.harakahdaily.net/" target="_blank"><i>Harakahdaily.net/en</i> </a>with the intention to reappraise the understanding of the Islamists and infuse progressive and democratic ideas. He also writes to other established web-portals such as <i>Malaysiakini</i>, <i>The Malaysian Insider</i> and <i>Free Malaysia Today</i>. He is also a steering committee member of BERSIH 2.0, a coalition promoting clean, free and fair elections. He is the founder and Director of<em> <a title="Islamic Renaissance Front" href="http://irfront.net/" target="_blank">Islamic Renaissance Front</a></em> (IRF), an intellectual movement and a think tank focusing on youth empowerment and promotion of intellectual discourse and reformation. Below is the summary of his paper presented at the<em> &#8220;<a title="Competing visions in the Muslim world" href="http://sydney.edu.au/arts/government_international_relations/News_and_Events/events/competing_visions_in_the_muslim_world_symposium.shtml" target="_blank">Competing visions in the Muslim world conference</a>.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>One of the emerging trends that may influence the trajectory of contemporary political Islam is the intrusion of Literal Islam. Obviously this worrying trend could be seen more clearly with the Arab Spring although the literalists were not initially at the forefront. They advocate the revival of pristine Islam and the establishment of Islamic states based on Sharia laws. Any other form of political systems or constitution are dismissed as un-Islamic and a manifestation of Western neo-colonialism.</p>
<p>Their thrust for political power can be felt as far as Maghribi in the West and stretches to Malaysia in the East. Although this project could be traced way back to the time of Islamism of the fundamentalist era, the idea was rejuvenated with the collapse of the many dictatorships during Arab Spring.</p>
<p>The whole fundamental percept of the Islamist project lies in the idea of God’s sovereignty. Any other forms of governments are basically human efforts to usurp the sovereignty of God by human. If two lines were to be drawn, a horizontal and a vertical, then the point of friction is when the two lines meet. People who believe in the strict definition of an Islamic state seek to interject their vertical relationship with God into the horizontal public spheres as a way of regulating human affairs.</p>
<p>The whole idea is based on the notion that a religion claims to be in possession of universal truth. The ideological rigidity often associated with this belief undermines tolerance, pluralism, and compromises all the crucial aspects of liberal democratic politics. And due to the pivotal status that Sharia occupies the economy of Islamic theological-legal discourse, <i>hudud</i> or divine punishment, has been elevated to the status of “holy grail” of many Islamist movements.</p>
<p>That is the main reason why there is a need for the separation of religion from politics. Religion is exclusionary because it sets up a boundary between believers and non-believers, whereas citizenship should not be based on adherence to God but rather on membership in a political society. And religion undermines the secular order in society that is needed to maintain a democratic peace. It basically seeks to collapse the distinction between the vertical and horizontal axis, and drags God from heavenly heights and injecting into the centre of public debate.</p>
<p>It must be stressed here that a call to establish a secular state is not similar in any ways to the call for secularising the society. A state should be secular in the sense that it is neutral to all the differing religious doctrines. It does not mean the exclusion of religion from the public life of a society. The misconception that it does, is one of the reasons many Muslims tend to be hostile towards the concept.</p>
<p>If Islam should still be seen to play a role in governance, then the main task is for it to be a guarantor of human dignity. It must ensure the physical safety of individual citizens, their rights to protect their family, the safety of their property, fairness in their profession and their full participation in civil society.</p>
<p>It should not be a catalyst for building an “ideological community”, to establish the so-called Islamic state, nor implementing Islamic laws and moral codes. Islam is no longer a solution to all problems or “<i>al-Islam huwa al-hal</i>”. Such a slogan is merely a plain rhetoric. The main focus should be on justice, equality and freedom.</p>
<p>The only way forward is to allow a space for intellectual discourse and to respect religious rights and freedom of conscience and expression. Islam and true religiosity could thrive better in a secular state that breaks down the monopoly of religious truth.  It is a space needed for a Muslim to live a life based on his own freewill and true conviction and not because of state’s imposition.</p>
<p>It must be pointed out that while religion is exclusionary, democracy is inclusive in nature, egalitarian and non-discriminatory. No man can monopolise to be speaking on behalf of God. The compatibility or incompatibility of a religion &#8211; including Islam – with democracy is not a matter of mere philosophical speculations, but of political struggle.</p>
<p>It is not as much the question of texts but more of the struggle of power between those who want a democratic religion and those who pursue an authoritarian version. And only in a secular democratic state, all citizens, believers no less than non-believers, and even believers from the various denominations, Sunni and Shii alike, will have the same basic reason to embrace the right to religious freedom. They will have total freedom from a government that wants to behave as an arbiter of religious truth or worse, a government that manifests its coercive power to impose religious authority and uniformity.</p></blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://asiapacific.anu.edu.au/newmandala/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Orang-kampong-pun-nok-perubohan.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-24233" alt="Orang kampong pun nok perubohan" src="http://asiapacific.anu.edu.au/newmandala/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Orang-kampong-pun-nok-perubohan-e1376389688185.jpg" width="425" height="319" /></a></span></p>
<p>Clive Kessler’s recent <a href="http://asiapacific.anu.edu.au/newmandala/2013/06/12/malaysias-ge13-what-happened-what-now-part-1/">article</a>, ‘Malaysia’s GE13: What happened, what now?’, is a plausible and insightful account of what was going through UMNO&#8217;s collective mind with respect to their GE13 strategy. In particular, his observation that rather different and even contradictory messages were delivered to international and domestic audiences is crucial to understanding UMNO’s general mindset and the campaign as a whole, and it is indeed a pity that these audiences do not seem to have compared notes.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, while understanding how UMNO thinks may be important and interesting, in the long run it is much more important to understand what was and is going through the minds of the voters themselves.</p>
<p>Kessler’s main argument in this direction is that, having first malapportioned the rural Malay vote in West Malaysia into disproportionate importance, UMNO won this vote – and the election – by creating a ‘Malay siege mentality’, to the detriment of PAS. This claim is based mainly on the increase of UMNO and the decrease of PAS seats in Parliament; one could also argue that it is supported by Thomas Pepinsky’s quantitative <a href="http://asiapacific.anu.edu.au/newmandala/2013/05/06/a-first-pass-at-the-ge13-results/">analysis</a>, showing positive correlation between the percentage of ‘Malay’ voters and the percentage of votes for Barisan Nasional for West Malaysian parliamentary constituencies. These analyses are necessarily incomplete, as they do not study in any detail the kingmaker in GE13: East Malaysia, with its 57 parliamentary seats (out of 222 in total). Moreover, important data exist which contradict Kessler’s story.</p>
<p>The most telling of these is the finding by the <a href="http://www.malaysiakini.com/news/230363">Merdeka Centre</a>, as reported by Malaysiakini, that ‘only 11 percent of Malays polled just before the 13th general election said the protection of Malay community interests and the community&#8217;s political clout was a concern’; the economy was their dominant preoccupation.</p>
<p>In addition,  <a href="http://academia.edu/3672205/Vote-seat_disproportionality_its_sources_and_possible_remedies_the_case_of_Malaysia_">Wong Chin Huat</a> argues in a data-based analysis that GE13 malapportionment was partisan rather than rural/urban or based on race. (See also related articles on <a href="http://www.fz.com/source/wong-chin-huat">fz.com</a> from June/July of this year). For example, he points out that the urban constituency of Alor Star has many fewer voters than Baling, which is rural, but is inclined to vote for the opposition and has a history of social <a href="http://www.malaysiakini.com/columns/231865">activism</a>. Wong points out further that the three Pakatan Rakyat parties – PKR, DAP and PAS – received similar numbers of votes; however, for reasons which remain unclear, PAS ‘paid’ the most votes per seat, followed by PKR then DAP. This led to the imbalance in the number of seats won by each party. So PAS did not lose votes in GE13, but they lost seats. In fact PAS’s share of the total vote <i>increased</i> from 14.05% to 14.77% while UMNO’s remained roughly constant (29.45% vs. 29.33% in 2008).</p>
<p>I would like to suggest that a hitherto neglected factor in GE13 analyses – the fact that the ‘manipulability’ of the vote is far from race-blind – will go some way towards reconciling several superficially contradictory analyses, such as those cited above, and yield additional insight into the thought processes of Malaysian voters.</p>
<p>It is easy to see that racially-weighted vote manipulation was a potentially significant factor in GE13. After decades of <a href="http://english.cpiasia.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=2272:hindraf-report-to-washington-institutional-racism-in-malaysia&amp;catid=78:Human%20Rights">institutional racism</a>, most public institutions, including the civil service and armed forces are now almost entirely made up of Malaysians officially classified as ‘Malay’. Other government-linked, centrally-controlled institutions engineered to be ‘Malay-dominated’ include Federal Land Development Authority (FELDA) settlements and public universities, particularly ‘bumiputera-only’ UiTM (which has 120,000 students). These institutions provide both means and opportunities for UMNO/BN to introduce pressure mechanisms operating on large blocs of voters who ‘just happen’ to be disproportionately ‘Malay’. Depending on the efficiency and extent of these mechanisms, they could significantly affect quantitative psephologic analyses such as Pepinsky’s: ‘statistical inclinations’ of voters labelled as ‘Malay’ to vote for UMNO/BN may exist for reasons quite unrelated to any function of their free will – or even their ‘ethnicity’ or ‘ethnic (siege) mentality’ as such – but simply because, by design, they formed the overwhelming majority of voters who were ‘in the wrong place at the wrong time’, e.g. in a naval base on (early) polling day. In other words, analyses such as Kessler’s may be naive in assuming that the only ‘racial’ levers UMNO/BN have are diffuse ‘ethnic psychological’ ones. In general, analyses of GE13 have neglected the effects of vote manipulation, whether racially-weighted or not, taking the official results at face value.</p>
<p>To be more specific, when one speaks of ‘vote manipulation’, there is most obviously outright fraud. Almost <a href="http://www.tindakmalaysia.com/showthread.php/6830-GE13-SPR-Statistics-on-EC-Officers-on-duty">400 000</a> civil servants and armed forces personnel and their spouses participated in advance or postal voting, which is seen as being <a href="http://zorro-zorro-unmasked.blogspot.fr/2009/09/my-friday-guest-blogger-on-saturday.html">easier</a> to <a href="http://steadyaku-steadyaku-husseinhamid.blogspot.fr/2009/09/malaysian-election-and-army-votes-ii.html">manipulate</a> than regular voting. For instance, ex-armed forces personnel have <a href="http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/nation/2011/08/04/ex-army-man-ordered-to-vote-bn/">alleged</a> that votes were cast ‘on their behalf’. It was also recently <a href="http://my.news.yahoo.com/ballot-papers-ec-officers-sold-bn-rm100-102120155.html">reported</a> that some Election Commission officers (almost always drawn from the civil service even though this does not in principle have to be the case) were offered RM100 for their ballots. Thus, given the large number of voters involved, efficient and discreet manipulation of early and postal voting by itself may already account for a large part of any difference in voting patterns between different ‘races’, and may have even <a href="http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/bn-kept-malaysia-thanks-to-postal-and-advance-votes1">won the elections</a> for UMNO/BN.</p>
<p>In addition to fraud, civil servants and armed forces personnel (~1.5 million voters out of a total of 13.3 million) face pressures of various kinds to vote a certain way – or not to vote – and never to oppose ‘the government’, which in certain contexts is code for the BN coalition. The ‘<i><a href="http://educationmalaysia.blogspot.fr/2005/08/aku-janji.html">Akujanji</a></i>’ that all civil servants have to sign is an explicit example of such <a href="http://news.asiaone.com/News/AsiaOne+News/Malaysia/Story/A1Story20090823-162807.html">pressure</a>. In the Bersih 2.0 preliminary <a href="http://www.bersih.org/?p=6122">report</a> on the elections, it was noted that ‘a military personnel, Major Zaidi was demoted for making a report about the ineffectiveness of the indelible ink’.</p>
<p>The fear-mongering has been so successful that well-educated, middle- and high-ranking civil servants have been known not to vote, fearing repercussions for their careers ‘if they find out that I voted for the opposition’. Even long-standing loyalties can be weakened by hierarchical pressures: Recently, after the school magazine had been printed, the principal of a school in my area went through every copy and tore out a page sponsored by the local Member of Parliament, ‘<i>dengan ingatan tulus ikhlas</i>’. The principal and the MP are (or perhaps were) childhood friends. (The MP is, obviously, from the federal opposition).</p>
<p>Just before GE 13, while visiting friends in a neighbouring village, I was asked by a university graduate in complete seriousness whether they, as a civil servant, were allowed to vote for the opposition. Such stories are legion. One also needs to bear in mind the existence of spillover effects on retirees and family members who are not included ~1.5 million figure above, especially spouses participating in early or advance voting. As another example, for a certain period of time my grandparents on one side (who were peasants) felt that they ‘should vote for the government’ (i.e. the BN in their minds) as many of their children were ‘working for the government’. This partly the result of continuous, long-term efforts by UMNO/BN to create a one-to-one identification in the minds of Malaysian between themselves and ‘the government’, e.g. by putting up signs saying ‘Satu Lagi Projek Kerajaan Barisan Nasional’ next to road works.</p>
<p>Pressure mechanisms in place in other ‘Malay-dominated’ public institutions (including FELDA and public universities) as well as the possibility that other vote manipulation strategies (such as <a href="http://www.sarawakreport.org/2013/05/caught-on-camera-bns-hatchet-faced-vote-buyers/">vote-buying</a> and <a href="http://www.sarawakreport.org/2013/07/how-taib-mahmud-rigged-the-baram-election/">closing polling stations early</a>) were racially-weighted will also need to be addressed in a full analysis of the situation.</p>
<p>What would have happened, and what might happen in future elections if these various vote manipulation techniques had been removed or at least rendered much less effective? On a global level, considering only postal and advance votes, a recent Merdeka Centre <a href="http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/bn-kept-malaysia-thanks-to-postal-and-advance-votes1">study</a> strongly suggests that the BN would have lost GE13. As a case study, the parliamentary constituency of Lumut, where Malaysia’s main naval base is located, could be of interest to inquiring journalistic or academic minds. During the last elections, rumours on the ground had it that the PKR candidate, retired admiral Mohamad Imran, as an ex-Navy insider was able to effectively counter vote-manipulation strategies usually employed for the Navy vote. He won his seat with 55.6% of the vote against BN/MCA’s Kong Cho Ha, the incumbent since 2004. In 2008, Kong Cho Ha had won in Lumut with 50.3% of the vote. Dare one suggest that the main reason for this upset might be fraud- and intimidation-minimisation rather than ‘racial concerns’? Dare one further suggest that other non-racial, non-religious factors may have also played important roles? One notes for instance <a href="https://www.rainforest-rescue.org/mailalert/919/malaysia-protect-the-rainforest-reserve-and-turtles">well-organised</a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/SelamatkanPenyuSegari">local opposition</a> to development projects in the Lumut area, based on environmental concerns. In addition, Mohamad Imran is seen by many locals as cleaner, more sincere, ‘truly religious’ (this from a non-Muslim local) and as having less baggage compared to Kong Cho Ha.</p>
<p>A Malaysian at Sciences Po recently wrote a fine <a href="http://unepetitepeu.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/suicides-in-france-a-public-act-krystle-wong.pdf">article</a> on public suicides in France, in which the reluctance of the SNCF (France’s national state-owned railway company) to ‘profile’ railway suicides was noted. One official was quoted as saying, ‘It’s a taboo subject. We don’t have any study on the profile – so to speak – of people who kill themselves&#8230;.It is delicate to interpret this. We should avoid hasty interpretations.’</p>
<p>One sometimes wonders if a small dose of this caution would not be salutary in analyses of Malaysian elections, especially race-based ones hastily done the day after the polls.</p>
<p>If one must nevertheless conduct race-based analyses of Malaysian elections, given the large number of voters potentially involved, it would only be intellectually honest to try to take into account the effect of racially-weighted vote manipulation – both in the form of fraud as well as undue influences through the institutions mentioned above (and likely others that have escaped my attention). Most commentators, if not all, have neglected to do this.</p>
<p>Apart from numerically estimating what the election results might have been in the absence of various forms of racially-weighted vote manipulation, among the questions one might attempt to answer is whether, as suggested by Wong Chin Huat, the electoral map was drawn with purely partisan interests in mind (in which case one might have expected all three PR parties to have had similar vote/seat ratios), or whether – more sinisterly – mechanisms were put in place to create a perception of racial polarisation for casual observers and ‘day after the polls’ analysts, reinforced by well-timed talk of ethnic tsunamis and ‘reconciliation’. Or perhaps both.</p>
<p>Before leaving this topic, I note another possibly statistically important factor for ‘race-based’ analyses: allegations that some voters, especially indigenous peoples, were prevented from voting [Read the following linkes:  <a href="http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/nation/2013/06/27/we-werent-allow-to-vote-in-tapah/">Link 1</a>. <a href="http://www.theborneopost.com/2013/05/13/roland-claims-irregularities-in-baram/#ixzz2TACgQfCd">Link 2</a>. <a href="http://teresakok.com/2013/06/12/support-for-serian/">Link 3</a>. <a href="http://www.sarawakreport.org/2013/07/how-taib-mahmud-rigged-the-baram-election/">Link 4</a>]. This could also lead one to ask to what extent the perception that East Malaysia is a BN fixed deposit is well-founded, and whether there was similar ‘orientally-weighted’ vote manipulation and to what extent this was effective. The upcoming Bersih 2.0 <a href="http://www.bersih.org/?p=6170">People’s Tribunal</a> on GE13, and any evidence this might yield, will be of great interest for developing these lines of thought.</p>
<p>It is, I admit, rather bad form to throw out ideas in this fashion without having done some of the number-crunching and on-the-ground investigation suggested. In my defence, my appointment is in physics and I have very limited time to work on Malaysian issues. These ideas are thus ‘up for adoption’ and I hope they will find good homes.</p>
<p>Coming back to Kessler’s article, he further suggests that his insights were missed by foreign journalists as well as the Malaysian pundits they had access to, the latter tending to be city slickers disconnected from the rural reality and fond of using words such as ‘discourse’ and ‘narrative’. Speaking only for myself, as someone who may have let slip even ‘<a href="http://asiapacific.anu.edu.au/newmandala/2013/05/17/ways-of-seeing-malaysia-deconstructing-demographic-violence/">hermeneutic</a>’ on occasion, I am for the record from Malaysia&#8217;s rural agricultural heartland, where my family has lived and tilled the land for generations. One school I attended had a dropout rate of 50% and was classified as ‘sekolah perintis’ – a euphemism if there ever was one. When I was a child, food was rationed in our home – and I am not talking about meat, which we almost never saw. So, some of us rural folk are out there, saying things, even if we do not always mention our roots.</p>
<p>Speaking therefore as your friendly neighbourhood country bumpkin, while it may be the case that many city-dwellers are disconnected from life in the country, the reverse is not necessarily true. Many rural families have children or other relatives who live and work in the city and through them news, goods and ideas make their way out into the country; this is increasingly the case as Malaysia continues to follow a trend of <a href="http://www.indexmundi.com/malaysia/urbanization.html">rapid urbanisation</a>. (72% of the population lived in urban areas in 2010, with an annual rate of increase of 2.4%. In addition, ~<a href="http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~eroberts/cs181/projects/2010-11/BrainDrain/Malaysia.html">1 million</a> Malaysians live abroad, about half of these in Singapore). It was precisely to make use of these ties to the city and the outside world that Haris Ibrahim has been running a ‘<a href="http://asalkanbukanumno.com/2012/08/01/kempen-balik-kampung-bawa-kebenaran/">balik kampung, bawa berita</a>’ <a href="http://harismibrahim.wordpress.com/2008/02/06/balik-kampung-bawa-berita-1/">campaign</a>. Proportionally fewer rural folk may be able to wax lyrical on notions such as ‘separation of powers’ and ‘independence of the judiciary’; however, ideas such as justice, honesty, kindness, generosity, openness and solidarity are universal values which can be understood by all. Some even say that these values are more present in the countryside, with its strong social networks, than in urban contexts. Let us not forget that, after all, the <a href="http://www.malaysiakini.com/columns/231865">Baling Incident</a> of 1975 happened in rural Baling and not urban Alor Star.</p>
<p>As for Kessler’s suggestion that most foreign journalists covering GE13 picked up only on a narrative carefully crafted for them by UMNO, I can only record my hearty and heartfelt agreement, having argued much the same <a href="http://asiapacific.anu.edu.au/newmandala/2013/05/17/ways-of-seeing-malaysia-deconstructing-demographic-violence/">elsewhere</a>. Lack of fluency in Malay and not travelling to rural West Malaysia or to East Malaysia are obstacles not only to understanding the ‘rural UMNO campaign’ and official government communications and circulars (not always translated into English, and not always available on the internet), but more importantly to picking up on the recent proliferation of rural- and East Malaysia-based social and civil initiatives, which communicate mainly or only in Malay and are not plugged into the international media circuit in the same way that UMNO is. Examples include <a href="https://www.facebook.com/PersatuanAnak">Persatuan Anak Peneroka FELDA Kebangsaan</a> (<a href="http://ms.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persatuan_Anak_Peneroka_Felda_Kebangsaan">ANAK</a>, recently interviewed on <a href="http://radiofreemalaysia.org/2013/03/keep-calm-and-carry-on/">Radio Free Malaysia</a>), Solidariti Anak Muda Malaysia (<a href="http://anakmudamalaysia.com/">SAMM</a>), the effort to &#8216;<a href="https://www.rainforest-rescue.org/mailalert/919/malaysia-protect-the-rainforest-reserve-and-turtles">Save Segari’s turtles</a>&#8216; previously mentioned, the Indigenous People’s Network of Malaysia (<a href="http://www.forestpeoples.org/topics/un-human-rights-system/publication/2013/universal-periodic-review-malaysia-indigenous-peoples">JOAS</a>, a coalition of ~60 organisations), Partners of Community Organisations in Sabah (<a href="http://www.pacostrust.org/">PACOS</a>) and East Malaysian <a href="https://www.facebook.com/SabahSarawak">movements</a> for a stronger <a href="http://fernandezjoe.blogspot.fr/2013/06/sabah-sarawak-activists-want-to-restore.html">regional identity</a> or even possibly secession from the Malaysian federation. Indeed, the rapid development and maturation of civil society across the whole of Malaysian society is perhaps <i>the</i> salient Malaysian political fact of the past 10-15 years, yet most GE13 analyses neglected to note or comment on this, even in an electoral context.</p>
<p>Finally, and as a Malaysian very sadly, I cannot help but agree with Kessler on the lack of vision in both major coalitions for the future of Malaysia. Economic management, public administration and other technical details aside, the philosophical and imaginative challenge before the Malaysian nation and whoever would lead her is this: How to think difference as beauty and peace instead of violence – violence whether in the form of the Apollonian totalitarianism of UMNO’s ‘<a href="http://asiapacific.anu.edu.au/newmandala/2013/05/17/ways-of-seeing-malaysia-deconstructing-demographic-violence/">MICO</a>’ or the Dionysian <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uI7xB3d2rNA&amp;feature=player_embedded">chaos</a> and <a href="http://gbgerakbudaya.com/2012/02/may-13-declassified-documents/">anarchy</a> with which UMNO <a href="http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/shahrizat-may-13-could-repeat-if-umno-weak/">threatens Malaysians</a> whenever they themselves <a href="http://www.loyarburok.com/2013/05/31/real-reason-crackdown/">feel threatened</a>?</p>
<p>The need to transcend this dialectic in thinking difference, and the urgency of the task, is making itself felt not only in Malaysia, but in almost every country in the world today, and in relations between nations. On both philosophical and sociological levels, Malaysians, perhaps especially Malaysian leaders, are in a unique position to propose inventive solutions to the problem, and thus to make a giant leap forward for mankind. Or instead to fail spectacularly.</p>
<p>Yet neither BN nor PR seems to be keeping up with the aspirations of the Malaysian people or to even be cognizant of the moral challenge that is before them, and its global implications.</p>
<p>After GE13, in which the majority of Malaysians voted against the <a href="http://asiapacific.anu.edu.au/newmandala/2013/05/17/ways-of-seeing-malaysia-deconstructing-demographic-violence/">MICO</a>-based status quo, the BN had two available courses of action to remain relevant: either to begin imagining something new by doing away with its race-based structure (e.g. <a href="http://www.thestar.com.my/News/Nation/2013/05/24/Single-party-Barisan-Nasional-is-feasible-says-Muhyiddin.aspx">merging</a> into a single party), or else to attempt squeeze the Malaysian people back into their ‘tried and tested’ (but now rapidly disintegrating) <a href="http://asiapacific.anu.edu.au/newmandala/2013/05/17/ways-of-seeing-malaysia-deconstructing-demographic-violence/">MICO</a> mould by redoubling their ‘racialising’ efforts. For the moment, it looks very much like UMNO/BN have chosen the second option, which puts them on a head-on collision course with the desires and the will of the Malaysian people.</p>
<p>Pakatan Rakyat, while decrying the overt racism of UMNO, its ideology of racial supremacy and its espousal of racial hatred, have for the most part contented themselves with grandstanding around ‘topical issues’ (often created ex nihilo then blown out of proportion by BN/UMNO-controlled media and institutions). They have, as Kessler noted, avoided addressing fundamental issues and have failed to present the Malaysian people with a coherent and convincing vision for a different and better Malaysia. Many of their statements and actions, including their ‘<a href="http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/opinion/adelyn-yeoh/article/so-banglasia-is-funny">Banglasia</a>’ rhetoric at the ‘<a href="http://hornbillunleashed.wordpress.com/2013/05/16/45731/">Black 505</a>’ rallies in the immediate aftermath of the elections show that they ‘don’t get it’ yet – ‘it’ being among other things the equal worth and dignity of each and every human person.</p>
<p>Malaysians deserve better from both coalitions. Ultimately, it may be the people themselves – drawing on their naturally abundant creativity, initiative and goodwill towards one another, and going around or the electoral gridlock through civil society – who will have to find the way forward for Malaysia, leaving their ‘leaders’ to follow and catch up as best as they can.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://asiapacific.anu.edu.au/newmandala/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Royal-Cremation-Ceremony.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-18984" alt="Royal Cremation Ceremony" src="http://asiapacific.anu.edu.au/newmandala/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Royal-Cremation-Ceremony.jpg" width="450" /></a></p>
<p>The Thai Foreign Ministry has recently shifted its orientation from promoting good relations with foreign countries to defending the monarchy at all cost. Since the military coup of 2006 that removed the elected government of Thaksin Shinawatra, almost all Thai state agencies have been immensely politicised. The Foreign Ministry is no exception. The situation worsened following the advent of a new Foreign Minister, Kasit Piromya, former ambassador and a known anti-Thaksin figure. Kasit embarked on prioritising the need to protect the monarchy from criticisms among those who lived outside Thailand. It was not surprising considering the alliance Kasit had forged with the royal establishment. However, what is more startling is the fact that the Yingluck Shinawatra government has also endorsed a pro-monarchy policy. This has reflected in the current foreign policy which targets those criticising the monarchy, Thais or foreigners, abroad.</p>
<p>For a while now, the Foreign Ministry has set up a unit within the Information Department designed to monitor those who live outside Thailand who may violate the lèse-majesté law. The Foreign Ministry has created its own “blacklist” in which the supposed violators of lèse-majesté law shall be charged once they set foot in Thailand. Possibly once a month, the unit, led by the Deputy Permanent Secretary, holds an internal meeting with the army in order to discuss strategies in the protection of the monarchy, compare their blacklists, and most importantly, determine who to be charged and how. The process of identifying enemies of the monarchy is somewhat confidential—they will not know that they are put in the list until they arrive in Thailand. Quite often, the army’s representatives are more anxious to press charges against any enemies abroad. Meanwhile, the Foreign Ministry is a little more cautious about the process, recognising that “once it ties the knot, it will have to explain this to the outside world.”</p>
<p>Typically, the meeting between the Foreign Ministry and the army covers discussions on any upcoming events overseas which are related to the monarchy and following the movements of the so-called enemies of monarchy abroad. On many opportunities, representatives of the National Security Council (NSC) are invited to participate in the discussions. Their presence is important, not only in providing intelligence information (which are most of the time unintelligent) but also in creating “myths” about anti-monarchy movements outside Thailand. For example, the Foreign Ministry and the army relied heavily on information from the NSC regarding anti-monarchy movements in the United States.</p>
<p>On the occasion that Professor Thongchai Winichakul at the Wisconsin-Madison University became the first Thai to head the Association for Asian Studies (AAS), the NSC produced a public article in Thai to connect the existence of such anti-monarchy movements in the US with Thongchai’s presidency of the AAS. It also claimed that the American anti-monarchy lobbyists worked intimately with the AAS in turning this academic platform into an organisation that aims at overthrowing the Thai monarchy. On top of this, the NSC also linked a particular panel at the previous AAS Meeting in San Diego on “The Monarchy in Post-Bhumibol Thailand” with the supposedly ongoing conspiracy in the United States. Accordingly, the Foreign Ministry instructed its Embassy in Washington DC and Consulate in Los Angeles to provide more information and to monitor the AAS closely. A representative from the Thai Consulate in Los Angeles was obviously among the attendees at the San Diego panel and took a lot of photos of panellists. A report on the result of the panel discussion was written and sent back to the Foreign Ministry headquarters on Sri Ayutthaya Road. Some panellists have been put on the list. One may never know when any charges are to be made against them.</p>
<p>At this critical juncture in Thailand which witnessed a deep political polarisation, instead of de-politicising issues related to the monarchy, state agencies have done the opposite. Thai diplomats have been told to defend the royal institution fiercely, even when they have to lie, cover up and twist facts. The battle against critics of the monarchy is likely to become more brutal as Thailand is approaching the end of the current reign.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://asiapacific.anu.edu.au/newmandala/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/outstation-logo-main-tagline-2-1.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-24230" alt="outstation-logo-main-tagline-2 (1)" src="http://asiapacific.anu.edu.au/newmandala/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/outstation-logo-main-tagline-2-1.png" width="556" height="120" /></a></p>
<p>We all know the numbers: <a title="Brain drain in Malaysia" href="http://asiapacific.anu.edu.au/newmandala/2011/09/21/brain-drain-in-malaysia/" target="_blank">1 million Malaysians</a> live abroad, of which roughly a third have tertiary degrees. They are the swooshing sound of Malaysia&#8217;s brain drain, and they&#8217;ve washed up as close as Singapore and as far away as Santiago.</p>
<p><strong>But who are they?</strong></p>
<p>Well, I was one. Up until recently, I lived with my American husband and our two young children in the US Midwest. We had a very nice life. The kids routinely introduced themselves as “<em>half-Minnesotan, half-Malaysian</em>.”</p>
<p>We moved back to Kuala Lumpur in 2011. Our American friends thought it was very cool that the kids would experience life in a faraway country. From our Malaysian friends, the reactions ranged from “<em>Why, ah?” to “Are you stupid/crazy?</em>”</p>
<p>The fact is we moved back for the most pedestrian of reasons – my parents were getting older, my brother had just married – and after almost half a lifetime of being away, it felt like time to be around for a while.</p>
<p>Moving home – with its joys and frustrations &#8211; got me thinking about the diaspora. A million Malaysians. Who are we? What are our lives like? What do we want? And why aren&#8217;t we talking to each other?</p>
<p>A little over a year ago, I started a website to try to kick-start that conversation. The name – <a href="http://www.outstation.my/">www.Outstation.my</a> – came over a brainstorming cup of coffee with Jahabar Sadiq, a Malaysian journalist who moved home from Jakarta to edit the <a title="The Malaysian Insider" href="http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/" target="_blank">themalaysianinsider.com</a> , and Poh Si Teng, a Malaysian multi-media journalist now with the New York Times.</p>
<p>The tagline: For Malaysians Abroad, Returnees and Everyone In-Between.</p>
<p>Why Outstation? Because a Malaysian in Milan or Melbourne is still a Malaysian at heart. They&#8217;re just, you know&#8230;.outstation.</p>
<p>Malaysia&#8217;s anti-brain drain agency, <a title="TalentCorp" href="http://www.talentcorp.com.my/" target="_blank">TalentCorp</a>, kicked in some advertising dollars, with no strings attached. To their credit, I never heard a complaint, not even when we launched Outstation with beautiful pictures of Bersih protests around the world.</p>
<p><strong>Outstation&#8217;s first year has been a blast.</strong></p>
<p>Malaysians Choy Leow in Minneapolis and Meera Feldberg in Washington, D.C. wrote about what it felt like to vote for the first time in the US presidential elections. K., a Malaysian who moved home with his English husband, told us how he found a new generation of gay-friendly Malaysians, yet struggles to tell his own mother.</p>
<p>Ahead of this year&#8217;s Malaysian election, Ai Leen Lim in London wrote a popular, irreverent postal voting blog, “Going Postal.”</p>
<p><strong>What&#8217;s this all for?</strong></p>
<p>The goal is not to persuade people to move back. Or away. They&#8217;re going to do it anyway.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s to get people talking about their experiences, motivations, hopes and dreams, for themselves and for Malaysia. So we can see new possibilities for our own lives and for the country we love.</p>
<p>And we&#8217;ll see where that leads us.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Melissa Crouch suggests that today's 8888 anniversary is a time to reflect on 25 years of a heroic and prolonged struggle for democracy]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://asiapacific.anu.edu.au/newmandala/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Myanmar-Times-on-88-Retrospective.png"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-24157" alt="Myanmar Times on 88 Retrospective" src="http://asiapacific.anu.edu.au/newmandala/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Myanmar-Times-on-88-Retrospective.png" width="450" /></a></p>
<p>Today is a day of mixed feelings for all those involved in Burma’s democracy movement. 8 August marks the 25th anniversary of the democracy uprising in Burma that was brutally crushed by the military regime.</p>
<p>The sweeping electoral victory of the National League for Democracy (NLD) that followed in 1990 was blatantly denied by the military. Many of the NLD&#8217;s elected members were locked away in prison under brutal conditions. The leader of the NLD, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, spent many years under house arrest.</p>
<p>In those dark years, a process of drafting a new constitution was initiated by the military. This was neither an inclusive, open nor participatory process. Proceedings were under strict control of the military. Any criticism of the constitution-making process was criminalised.</p>
<p>From 1988 to 2011, the military ruled in Burma (which it changed to ‘Myanmar’) without a constitution. Since 2011, the regime has allowed for a transition to a more democratic form of government led by a civilian-military government. The 2008 Constitution was a key part of this process. Yet the form of legality it endorses is one that ensures the executive-military remains in firm control of the transition process.</p>
<p>In February 2013, the reformist President Thein Sein announced that a committee would be established in the national parliament to consider amendments to the Constitution. This has created a welcome window of opportunity for constitutional reform. This potential avenue for real change is important for a number of reasons.</p>
<p>First, the 2015 elections are fast approaching. The 2008 Constitution was specifically designed to ensure that Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, as the leader of the democracy movement, could never run as president. The provisions on the requirements of a presidential candidate must be amended so that she is allowed to be nominated as president by the presidential electoral college.</p>
<p>The second is the role of the military. The 2008 Constitution appears to implicitly sanction the military as a fourth branch of government. It allows the military to occupy a quarter of the seats in parliament, and it leaves open the possibility for the military to take over power at any time. The Commander-in-Chief also occupies a position that potentially rivals that of the President, and his powers in a state of emergency are absolute. These privileges amount to abuse of the rule of law and must be abolished. Seats in parliament should not be reserved for the military, and the military must be made subordinate to the executive branch.</p>
<p>The third is the separation of powers. While the Constitution recognises a limited form of the separation of powers, it is clear that the executive retains control over both the judiciary and the legislature. It is vital that a separation of the branches of government is made real. In particular, the judiciary must be granted independence through a transparent appointment process and security of tenure.</p>
<p>Fourth, the ‘f’ word – federalism – is a festering issue that remains to be addressed. At its heart is the relation between the central government and local communities. The key consideration is to give greater powers to the States and Regions to govern their own affairs. At present, the Chief Ministers of the States and Regions are appointed by the President. At the very least, this appointment process must change so that the States and Regions are empowered to independently appoint their own Chief Ministers. An additional step forward would be to empower State and Regional governments to manage their own affairs, without threat of national government interference.</p>
<p>Finally, this amendment process must open up opportunities for future constitutional amendments. The Constitution sets an extremely high benchmark in order to pass amendments. It requires more than 75 per cent of all representatives in the national parliament, as well as more than half the votes at a national referendum. This leaves no doubt that the military controls the current constitutional amendment process, given that it occupies 25 per cent of the seats in parliament. The provision on amending the Constitution must be amended to ensure that this is no longer the case.</p>
<p>The list of potential amendments could on: real guarantees for human rights, independence for the Union Election Commission, greater mechanisms for accountability of government action, just to name a few. Yet the above issues would be a real start. These formal and structural reforms to the legal order would then open the way for more substantive changes to take place.</p>
<p>The 8888 anniversary is a time to reflect on 25 years of a heroic and prolonged struggle for democracy, one that continues today. But it must also be a time to look forward, and to see this opening for constitutional amendment as the key to a genuine and fair political contest in the 2015 elections.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Elvin Ong reviews Floating on a Malayan Breeze, a "bottom-up" perspective on contemporary Singapore and Malaysia.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://asiapacific.anu.edu.au/newmandala/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Floating.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-24146" alt="Floating" src="http://asiapacific.anu.edu.au/newmandala/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Floating.jpg" width="297" height="447" /></a></p>
<p><b style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">Sudhir Thomas Vadaketh, <i>Floating on a Malayan Breeze: Travels in Malaysia and Singapore</i></b></p>
<p><b style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">Hong Kong and Singapore: Hong Kong University Press and NUS Press, 2012.  Pp. viii, 282; map, photographs, notes, index.</b></p>
<p><b style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">Reviewed by Elvin Ong</b><b style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">Ever since Singapore’s split from Malaysia in 1965, the government of each country has been bent on directing its trajectory away from that of the other.  This tendency perhaps peaked during the governments of the two countries’ most renowned authoritarian leaders, Lee Kuan Yew and Mahathir Mohamad. Singapore was always going to be what Malaysia was not. Malaysia was always going to go its own way, irrespective of what Singapore did. So dominant are the two opposing caricatures that have emerged – one clean, one dirty; one efficient, one corrupt; one carefree, one perpetually stressed – that we very often forget that Singapore and Malaysia have a shared past in British Malaya and that they have always been dependent on each other, at least in the economic realm.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">In an attempt to correct this view, Sudhir Thomas Vadaketh, the Singaporean-born son of a Malaysian-born father, declares early in </span><i style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">Floating on a Malayan Breeze </i><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">that the book is his attempt to provide what has been a missing “bottom-up perspective in national discourse” by writing about the two countries “as seen from the ground” (p. vi). On the one hand, he relates encounters with random personalities from Singapore, with people met during his month-long biking expedition around Peninsular Malaysia in 2004, and with various interesting individuals whom he interviewed on the ground during the campaign for the watershed 2008 Malaysian elections. On the other, he shares pieces of personal insight about the socio-political development of the two countries in the past decade. The resulting book is part travelogue and part socio-political commentary, a somewhat frustrating combination that is enjoyable, but that also raises more questions than it answers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">Sudhir’s vivid descriptions of his interviews and of the challenges encountered during his travels in Malaysia often set the stage for his larger points. Throughout the book, we are drawn into his conversations with various “big” and “small” personalities across the political spectrum in Malaysia. Some “big” personalities include Steven Gan, co-founder of the Web-site Malaysiakini</span><i style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">,</i><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;"> and Nurul Izzah, the incumbent member of parliament for Lembah Pantai – better known, perhaps, as the daughter of Anwar Ibrahim, the </span><i style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">de facto</i><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;"> leader of the political opposition to Malaysia’s Barisan Nasional government. The interviews with such “big” individuals are useful to the extent that they provide a sliver of insight into these individuals’ backgrounds and their motivations for driving socio-political change in Malaysia today.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">But as Sudhir demonstrates, “small” characters often have important, sometimes much more important, stories to tell. Betty owns a nondescript souvenir shop just across the border from Malaysia in Betong, Thailand. She was a former guerrilla soldier with the Communist Party of Malaya (CPM), which fought against the British, Japanese and newly-independent Malayan and Malaysian governments for a Communist Malaya. She is uniquely positioned to help Sudhir excavate a broader point about the CPM’s forgotten role in Malaya’s independence movement. Mr Liew is a Chinese businessman and eager supporter of the Parti Islam Se-Malaysia (PAS) in Kota Bharu, Kelantan. He punctures the stereotype that PAS is an extremist Malay political party that does not know how to “do” development. In a sense, these colourful “small” characters like Betty and Mr Liew are the gatekeepers for forgotten or interesting stories. They give life to staid political-science theories and dull academic writing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">Yet, for all the fascinating interviews and insights that Sudhir’s encounters with such people provide, it is difficult to make sense of them in a coherent manner, except in the context of Sudhir’s personal interpretation and commentary. Although he tries his best to make many good points about many salient topics, this is also where the book hits some serious snags.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">First, and even if we set aside the dire lack of a common thread running through his book (a lack due to its being written, in part, on the basis of random encounters during a bicycle expedition), Sudhir dithers between perpetuating stereotypes about Singapore and Malaysia and countering those stereotypes. As the book’s title suggests, Sudhir constantly “floats” between repeating official dominant ideologies and noting the various instances in which they require qualification, so much so that one cannot quite conclude what to make of the issue. For example, in the process of stressing the divergence between race-conscious Malaysia and race-neutral, meritocratic Singapore, Sudhir brings up so many qualifications to the idea of meritocracy in Singapore that one wonders if they negate the entire hegemony of meritocracy at all! He notes that senior management from India working in Singapore often hire their own kind, that he himself suffered from racial stereotyping when growing up, that the Singaporean Malay-Chinese taxi driver Ishak vows to retire in Thailand because he can no longer tolerate the racial stereotyping in Singapore, and that Malay Singaporeans still cannot serve in sensitive sectors in the Singapore Armed Forces. It appears that Singapore – both the government and the people – is as race-conscious as Malaysia after all.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">Second, Sudhir often ruminates on a wide variety of important social issues in the two countries – media control and censorship, the nascent development of civil society, the influx of immigrants, the growing income gap, </span><i style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">bumiputera</i><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;"> affirmative-action policies, religiosity, family planning and urban stress – without actually coming to any definitive conclusion about what indeed </span><i style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">should</i><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;"> or </span><i style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">will</i><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;"> be the way forward. This deficiency is most clearly exposed in two chapters discussing the gradual decline of the United Malays National Organisation in Malaysia and the People’s Action Party in Singapore. After much discussion of race-based politics in the former party and the iron cage of group-think in the latter, Sudhir concludes with a meek “It will be interesting to see how long they last” (p. 92).  While some students or casual readers may find this conclusion satisfying, serious academics will find such a concluding line entirely frustrating. Where is the comparative theory on authoritarian regimes?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">Third and finally, while as a fellow Singaporean I strongly concur and empathize with Sudhir’s description of recent trends in Singapore society, I cannot help having the nagging feeling that both of us are trapped with the same stereotypical worldview and narrative of what Singapore is, with both of us having good university educations and mixing in similar circles. (Full, though late, disclosure: I met very briefly with Sudhir at the videotaping of a debate about Lee Hsien Loong and was an intern in the Civil Service College under Donald Low, one of his few Singaporean interviewees.) What would be the worldview of the young Singaporean McDonald’s deliveryman? Or the elderly cashier at NTUC FairPrice supermarket? Or the uncle sipping his potent brew of Guiness or Heineken and ice cubes at the local coffee shop? Or the multitude of people who queue up in the wee hours of the morning for a chance to buy a “Hello Kitty” toy from, again, McDonald’s? There is a reason that Jack Neo, arguably Singapore’s most successful movie director as measured in box office receipts, consistently makes movies that break record after record at the cinemas, even though many educated intellectuals find his movies generally crass and distasteful. Perhaps Jack Neo understands the Singaporean psyche better than we do? Are we already victims of the growing inequality that we constantly deride?</span></p>
<p><i style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">Floating on a Malayan Breeze </i><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">serves as a good introductory text for readers unfamiliar with Singapore and Malaysia, or for students and the general public who have for far too long been fed state-endorsed narratives of the history and social development of their respective countries. The book’s vivid and somewhat witty writing brings many of its interviews to life, and, before long, the reader will find an unconscious smile creeping across his or her own face as he or she ponders what is unfolding between Sudhir and the interviewee. But this book is no serious academic research. Random sampling does not necessarily result in a representative sample. Anecdotal evidence is not robust evidence. Scholars who already know both countries well may be able to glean some nuggets of interesting insights, but they are unlikely to advance their knowledge of the two countries in any serious way.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://asiapacific.anu.edu.au/newmandala/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Cambodia.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-24133" alt="Cambodia" src="http://asiapacific.anu.edu.au/newmandala/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Cambodia.jpg" width="489" height="293" /></a></p>
<p>Over the last decade, a remarkable political transformation has been taking place in many Southeast Asian countries, from mainland states like Burma and Thailand to maritime states like Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore. The power of the old political establishments has been declining or contested by the emergence of powerful challenging forces. The decline of the old institutions is commonly attributed to some of the following conditions—domestic socio-economic and demographic change, the emergence and expansion of the middle-class, the governments’ longheld grip on power, and the tactics of the challenging forces using new modes of communication such as mobile phones and social media.</p>
<p>Cambodia’s old political establishment is now joining this regional trend. The previously unchallengeable power of incumbent Prime Minister Hun Sen, Asia’s longest-serving prime minister, is now being fiercely contested leading to a new set of questions about the country’s political future. The unofficial result of the recent July 2013 national election shows Hun Sen’s Cambodian People’s Party (CPP) falling from 90 in the 2008 election of the parliament’s 123 seats to 68 in this election and the surge of the Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP), a merging of the Sam Rainsy Party and the Human Rights Party in 2012, from 29 to 55. Furthermore, the opposition party claims the number of seats would have been higher had there not been election irregularities.</p>
<p>This is the first time since the 1993 national election that the ruling party’s seats dropped and the opposition party’s rose.</p>
<p>What is more remarkable is (based on the unofficial result), CNRP managed to perform well in CPP’s rural strongholds; leading the CPP in at least three populous provinces and falling just behind it in others. And this shift in political allegiance prompted local and international observers to ask the big question—why?</p>
<p>While many analysts attribute CPP’s decline and CNRP’s rising popularity to demographic change, the role of social media and other factors (including the ruling party’s abuse of human rights and its lack of a determination to fight corruption and social injustice), my perspective emphasizes two factors—<i>the people’s desire to improve their livelihoods and CNRP’s</i> <i>innovative election campaign policy targeting household income</i>. I do not deny the significance of the broader above-mentioned factors, but see them as playing a secondary role and appealing to a small segment of the population, limited to urban areas only. Those factors, i.e., demography, social media, corruption and injustice   cannot explain why people in rural areas, previously strong supporters of the ruling party, shifted their allegiance to the opposition party.</p>
<p><b><i>Cambodian people’s desire to improve livelihoods</i></b></p>
<p>The maintaining of peace, political stability and development by Prime Minister Hun Sen’s ruling party over the last two decades has attracted foreign investment and tourists, and thus led to the emergence and expansion of the rich and the middle-class residing in cities and towns and an increasing number of young rural folks migrating to urban areas in search of jobs and opportunities.</p>
<p>From the beginning of his fourth mandate of 2008, Hun Sen, with the financial backing of tycoons and Chinese loans, has focused on developing public infrastructure especially roads and bridges linking cities with provinces and towns with villages. The improved extensive road networks have increased the intensity and frequency of rural-urban/ village-town interaction, thus changing rural people’s perspectives on life and their relations with the state.</p>
<p>Because Cambodia’s civil war over two decades prevented the construction and restoration of roads and bridges, rural life was usually isolated with limited connections to cities. The road networks coupled with private bus companies offer daily transportation between Phnom Penh and provinces have reduced travelling time from days and weeks to hours. When rural people travel to cities and towns, they see new cars, motorbikes, beautiful houses and the luxurious items of the rich and the middle-class urban dwellers. This prompts them to reflect on their poor village life, and kindles a desire to connect to any source of power that promises them opportunities for livelihood improvement.</p>
<p>To some, being poor is no longer acceptable as part of their <i>karma </i>from a previous life based on the Buddhist notion or the normality of rural village life. So when the CNRP offers them a more promising livelihood options than that of the ruling party, they are ready to shift their political allegiance. Now having glimpsed new life possibilities through improved road networks, voters want more. It looks like Hun Sen’s CPP has become a victim of its own success.</p>
<p><b><i>CNRP’s policy of increasing household income</i></b></p>
<p>For the first time in the July 2013 national election, the opposition party offered a policy that promised to increase family household income. In previous elections, their campaign policies focused more on promoting democracy, fighting corruption, building independent judiciary and state institutions and dealing with illegal Vietnamese migrants. These policies appealed to urban dwellers and the circle of Cambodian educated and nationalist elites, while the majority of ordinary people especially those in rural areas could not grasp these concepts and could not work out the direct relationship between these big ideas and their everyday lives.  In previous elections, the opposition party promised, vaguely, to improve people’s livelihoods.</p>
<p>In this latest election, the CNRP offered policy supporting household income in clear numbers. They promised that if they won the election, the CNRP-led government will offer US$10 a month to people over the age of 65 as part of the government’s welfare scheme, a minimum wage of US$ 150 a month to workers in the garment and shoe industry, a minimum monthly salary of US$ 250 to public servants, and an increase in salary to personnel in the police and the military.</p>
<p>This promise of aggressive increase in family household income appealed to both urban and rural dwellers and to voters of all age groups and has significantly boosted CNRP’s popularity among voters. Under the current Hun Sen government, garment factory workers receive a monthly minimum wage of more than US$70 and ordinary public servants receive their monthly salary of less than US$100. These monthly wage and salary rates do not satisfy many workers and ordinary public servants because they are insufficient against the rising cost of living and do not support their new life aspirations.</p>
<p>So it is the magic of the numbers 10, 150, and 250 that has enabled the CNRP to penetrate CPP’s rural power base and increase its popularity in urban areas. The garment and shoe industry employs more than 350,000 young workers, many of whom come from rural areas and send small amounts of money to their parents back home in villages. It is almost impossible to imagine that their parents, siblings, grandparents, and relatives in extended families back home were not happy with the prospect of a monthly wage increase.</p>
<p>Unlike western families in which members hold different bank accounts, Cambodian families pool money for the common use of the family. Therefore, an increase in income for one member contributes to an increase in the entire family household income. So when many of these 350,000 workers combined with approximately 200,000 public servants influenced their family members to vote for the party that promised them an increase in salary, we see a huge surge in the number of people casting votes for the opposition party.</p>
<p>The US$10 a month welfare scheme is attractive to old people especially those in rural areas and has provided another route for the CNRP to penetrate rural family and village life. In Cambodian society, old people command respect and hold moral authority in both the families and the villages. Their influence on others in their families and villages to vote for the opposition party cannot be underestimated. It is not clear whether the CNRP’s campaign strategists had prior knowledge of the implications of their welfare scheme and wage increase policy in regards to Cambodian family’s household income management and village’s social structure.</p>
<p>The opposition party had difficulty spreading its message since the ruling party holds a tight grip over most local media outlets. Nevertheless, its ideas managed to reach rural areas through rumour and word of mouth. Cambodian rural social communities are held together by ceremonies and religious rituals. People gather together and help each other during weddings, funerals, housewarming ceremonies etc. And it is hard to imagine that people did not pass on and discuss the new income-improving policies.</p>
<p>So I do not see demographic change, social media, allegations of the ruling party’s abuse of power and human rights as the main factors driving the country’s recent political transformation as many analysts have suggested. This notion of people’s grievance that has turned many voters from CPP to CNRP is just secondary.</p>
<p>What has actually given popularity to the CNRP in both urban and rural areas is the intersection between people’s desire to improve their livelihoods and CNRP’s magic numbers 10, 150, and 250 that people can relate to easily. Rural people voted for CPP in previous elections mainly because they saw Prime Minister Hun Sen’s offer of peace and building roads as benefiting their daily lives. But once peace and extensive road networks were in place, people start to ask what else can his government offer and they are ready to shift their vote to any party which can respond to their new aspirations.</p>

<p><b>Jessica M. Chapman,<i> Cauldron of Resistance: Ngo Dinh Diem, the United States, and 1950s Southern Vietnam.</i> </b></p>
<p><b>Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 2013. Pp. xiii, 276; map, photographs, appendix, notes, bibliography, index. </b></p>
<p><b>Reviewed by Shawn McHale.</b></p>
<p>In <i>The Age of Empire, </i>Eric Hobsbawm, reflecting on the canonical break of 1914, notes that those who have approached that year “can be divided into two camps: the forward lookers and the backwards lookers.” One group sees the period from 1875 to 1914 as the end of an era; the other “seeks those roots and anticipations of our time.”<b>(1)</b>  If we could expand this observation, it seems clear that many historians, the world over, fall into either forward-looking or backward-looking camps. Jessica Chapman’s book is, overall, forward-looking. It is not deeply concerned with understanding the end of the era of French empire in Asia.</p>
<p>At the same time, Chapman is not only focused on the ascent of Ngô Đình Diệm and the Americans in South Vietnam.  She is quite aware that significant legacies from the First Indochina War shaped South Vietnam’s politics and Ngô Đình Diệm’s interactions with the United States. In showing the importance of such legacies to a major turning point in South Vietnam’s brief history, she has penned a significant contribution to Vietnamese studies.</p>
<p><i>Cauldron of Resistance</i> is a well-written work. Chapman examines the rise of Ngô Đình Diệm, and his consolidation of power, in the mid-1950s. In the process, she argues for the centrality of the Cao Đài and Hòa Hảo politico-religious organizations and the Bình Xuyên nationalist outlaws to any understanding of mid-1950s South Vietnam. Chapman is right on target. These organizations were important to southern politics in the 1950s, and marginalizing them from the status of major players simply attests to a Saigon-centric view of that politics.  Further, while Chapman’s book focuses on the twists and turns of politics in only one part of Vietnam – the South – she does not shy away from addressing large topics, such as the Cold War and US-South Vietnam relations.</p>
<p>Chapman’s work contrasts with the dominant approach to Vietnam in the mid-1950s. For most Western historians of South Vietnam, the issues in this period are clear: the end of French rule, the controversial ascension of Ngô Đình Diệm (including his crackdown on the Communists) and, last but not least, the deepening ties with the United States.  Such accounts pay little attention to the creation of the State of Vietnam in 1949 and its slow accretion of sovereignty.  They treat the religious groups and gangsters prominent  in the South as minor oddities, good for an exoticizing account of southern Vietnam,  but secondary to the “main story.  Most recent works regard these groups as minor players. Thus, in his beautifully written history of the First Indochina War, Fredrik Logevall flits over the politico-religious groups, implicitly seeing them as marginal to an understanding of mid-1950s South Vietnam.<b>(2)</b>  Ed Miller, in his pathbreaking new work on Ngô Đình Diệm (<a href="http://asiapacific.anu.edu.au/newmandala/2013/05/17/review-of-misalliance-tlc-nmrev-li/">recently reviewed in this series by Keith Taylor</a>), avoids the bane of exoticizing the politico-religious sects and the Bình Xuyên, but pays little attention to them.<b>(3)</b></p>
<p>Chapman implicitly presents the view that, because French power was  fading from 1945 to 1954 and American power rising, one does not need to delve into the French in great detail.  The end of empire, however, had its complications, and one of the oddities of the First Indochina War was that French influence in the South remained strong up to 1954. (After that point, it began to decline precipitously.) It was a peculiar type of influence.  Nevertheless, with the help of the Cao Đài, Hòa Hảo, Bình Xuyên, and Unités Mobiles de Défense de la Chrétienté, the French military did essentially defeat the Việt Minh in the Mekong delta by 1953, and in the process profoundly shaped rural southern Vietnam’s political landscape.</p>
<p>Reading Chapman, one gets the sense that the French – and earlier Vietnamese governments – left southern Vietnam a mess.  Chapman repeatedly characterizes the region as the “wild south” (pp. 13, 14, 15, 32, 38, for instance), a description that indeed fits the South before 1951 or so, but less well after that year. She also refers to the “almost anarchic south” (p .70), calls it a “site of near anarchy” (p. 74), and quotes approvingly Jean Lacouture’s and Philippe Devillers’s description of the South as “a country ruined, cancerous, stunned – a sentence in suspension” (p. 74).<b>(4)</b>   Yet such descriptions are problematic. The South had just emerged from a war, but it was clear that by 1953 the countryside was far more peaceful than a few years earlier, and order was returning to the Mekong Delta.</p>
<p>Chapman’s descriptions of “anarchy” conflate two separate realities: one of high politics in Saigon, and the other of everyday politics in the countryside.  With the French leaving, high politics was indeed unsettled and rapidly changing. Everyone was gunning for control of the national state apparatus and its finances. But what about the provinces? Far from being anarchic, the South was balkanized into areas under the control of different confessional groups or of the Bình Xuyên.  By 1953, this balkanization had evolved into a somewhat stable system, though one that would have to change as the Saigon government grew in power and tried to impose its will on the countryside.</p>
<p>At times, Chapman characterizes the politico-religious groups with loaded language, as when she refers to the “cunning” (p. 95) of their generals and quotes, apparently approvingly, Joseph Buttinger’s characterization of them as “devious collaborators” (<i>ibid.</i>).  Interestingly enough, such descriptions echo the those found in French archives. I would suggest instead that the heads of politico-religious groups were remarkably rational individuals intent on preserving their past gains but also interested in recognition as major political players.</p>
<p>The heart of this book is the story of Diệm’s rise, defeat of the politico-religious groups and the Bình Xuyên, and consolidation of power.  Ed Miller, in his recent book, has stated that, “during the Indochina War of 1945-1954, Diem was among the most prominent of Vietnam’s <i>attentistes</i> [fence-sitters],”  “adopting an uneasy neutrality” in the conflict between the Việt Minh and the French.<b>(5)</b>  To state this more bluntly, Diệm did little to defeat the Việt Minh. His record contrasts sharply with those of the Cao Đài, Hòa Hảo, and Bình Xuyên, each of which took on the Việt Minh in the Mekong Delta and elsewhere at great human cost.  Is it any surprise that these groups believed that they had a strong claim for political influence in South Vietnam?  Despite Diệm’s signal lack of contribution to fighting the Việt Minh, he swooped in as a national political leader, pushing aside these groups. If Chapman had provided more treatment of the actions of Cao Đài, Hòa Hảo, and Bình Xuyên in rural areas, and how these actions gave them a significant political base, she would have strengthened her book considerably.</p>
<p>That being said, Chapman provides an excellent account of Diệm’s rise to power, which coincided with the United States pushing France out of its position of influence. What comes through in this account is American ignorance of the intracies of southern Vietnamese politics as well as Ngô Đình Diệm’s simplistic understanding of the role of that politics in the First Indochina War. Chapman labels the Bình Xuyên – the conflict with which was one of Ngô Đình Diệm’s first major tests – one of southern Vietnam’s “politico-religious organizations” (p. 4, for example).  Diệm struck first where he was strongest – in Saigon itself – and rooted the Bình Xuyên out of its control over the Saigon police and gambling rackets.  I would emphasize that the Bình Xuyên was composed of nationalist outlaws, but it was <i>not</i> a politico-religious organization,  as Chapman repeatedly implies or states. The Cao Đài and Hòa Hảo were such organizations. The main factions of these two politico-religious organizations allied with the Bình Xuyên out of considerations of political realism dating back to 1947 and 1948.  The attack on the Bình Xuyên did little to challenge the power of the Cao Đài and Hòa Hảo in the provinces, where their bases of support lay.</p>
<p>Indeed, one of the puzzles of Diệm’s seizure of power is his ability to defeat the Hòa Hảo and Cao Đài easily. Both groups, which had large rural followings, had repeatedly beaten back the Việt Minh in the 1940s and 1950s; they had proven militarily effective. Why, then, did they crumble before a premier with an uncertain power base who often seemed on the verge of being deposed? Chapman provides the probable answer to this question: the fact that Diệm bribed his opponents (apparently with American-supplied money) and thus divided them. I would have liked to see more on this issue, though it is notably hard to research.  The Hòa Hảo, Cao Đài, and Bình Xuyên were particularly vulnerable in 1955, as the French had just terminated financial support for their armies. The question remains, however: how could bribery do what the Việt Minh could not and defeat these organizations? It would have been valuable for Chapman, eschewing a Saigon-centered narrative, to have dug more deeply into the situation in provincial South Vietnam in search of a sense of how local militias fared when their finances were hit.</p>
<p>Once Diệm began consolidating control in Saigon and the Mekong Delta, he turned to demonizing the Cao Đài and Hòa Hảo in 1955 and 1956.  Chapman makes a major contribution by delving into this issue and its consequences. Diệm lumped together the politico-religious groups and the Communists as enemies of government.</p>
<p>Conflating these three groups [of feudalists, colonialists, and Communists], served to justify violent action against any of them as a noble defense of Vietnam’s national integrity . . . Any evidence of collusion he could find would provide useful fodder for propaganda, but even without it he could tar them all with the same brush. In his view, they were all “enemies of the people” because they were all communists or communist sympathizers by definition. (p. 120).</p>
<p>This is excellent analysis. Chapman adds extensive evidence of Diệm’s crackdowns on all sorts of perceived enemies, in a campaign that temporarily led to peace in the South but that did not resolve the fundamental problems with Diệm’s rule.</p>
<p>I have a great deal of appreciation for this work, which emphasizes what so often is seen as a minor story in 1950s South Vietnam. For the story of the confessional groups like the Cao Đài and Hòa Hảo and of the Bình Xuyên was certainly not minor, or marginal to an understanding of the South and in particular of the Mekong delta. It is remarkable in a way that Diệm, who had done so little to fight the Communists during the First Indochina War compared to the Hòa Hảo and Cao Đài, was able to turn around and cast those latter groups as alleged Communist sympathizers.  The majority of their factions had been implacably opposed to the Communist-led Việt Minh during the First Indochina War.  In associating the Cao Đài and Hòa Hảo with the Communists, Diệm demonstrated an ability to to engage in unprincipled gutter politics with the best of them.</p>
<p>At the same time, <i>Cauldron of Resistance</i> suggests the limits of understanding South Vietnam through a Saigon lens, which is what Chapman mostly does. The Cao Đài, Hòa Hảo, Bình Xuyên, and other groups had played key roles in rural southern Vietnam since 1945. The idea that they would just fade away, and that Diệm’s victory in Saigon would translate into victory in the provinces and into rural support for his government, was a chimera. Examining this provincial story more intensively would have added complexity and depth to Chapman’s account. In the end, after all, Diệm would be overthrown, but the Cao Đài and Hòa Hảo would still play important roles in southern society.  They are with us today. Despite her lack of attention to the dynamics of rural politics, Chapman has nevertheless written an excellent work, one that helps us reframe our understanding southern Vietnam during the 1950s.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://asiapacific.anu.edu.au/newmandala/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Najib-and-Psy.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-24122" alt="Najib and Psy" src="http://asiapacific.anu.edu.au/newmandala/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Najib-and-Psy-e1375313871934.jpg" width="430" height="322" /></a></p>
<p>The United Malays National Organisation (UMNO), in coalition with partners in the Barisan Nasional (BN), has held office since independence in 1957. Its record of unbroken rule exceeds any other government in power today.</p>
<p>In 2008 the BN lost its two thirds majority, and in 2013 lost even more seats and for the first time since 1969 lost the popular vote. It gained only 47.4% of the national vote, though because of weighting in favour of rural electorates this meant 60% of parliamentary seats. Can UMNO rely on this rural weighting to maintain its position as support for the BN continues to decline? Can it remain credible when its non-Malay allies struggle to gain popular support? What strategies might it pursue to retain its dominance?</p>
<p>The opposition is an unlikely coalition of Islamists and secularists, socialists and capitalists, conservatives and progressives, Muslims and non-Muslims. In recent elections they won 51.8% of the total vote, and 40% of parliamentary seats. Can they maintain unity and continue to make inroads against the ruling coalition?</p>
<p>What will be new forms of political contestation post GE13? Will Sabah and Sarawak remain a ‘fixed deposit’ for the BN? Has political polarisation reduced the possibility of a more deliberative, open and democratic system? Might new political actors emerge to challenge the options presented by the government and opposition? What will the new rules of engagement be?</p>
<p><b>Date: 20<sup>th</sup> August, 2013</b></p>
<p><b>Time: 7.30-9.00pm</b></p>
<p><b>Venue: Bruce Hall (Dining Hall)<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://asiapacific.anu.edu.au/newmandala/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/UMNO-manliness.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-24115" alt="UMNO manliness" src="http://asiapacific.anu.edu.au/newmandala/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/UMNO-manliness.jpg" width="432" height="324" /></a></p>
<p>My recent chapter in <i>Queer Sexualities: Diversifying Queer, Queering Diversity</i> entitled “<a href="https://www.interdisciplinarypress.net/online-store/ebooks/diversity-and-recognition/queer-sexualities">Malaysian Masculine Exposé: Queering the Politics of Non-Heteronormative Malay-Muslim Men</a>” argues that non-heteronormative Malaysian Malay-Muslim men confront and lay bare political agendas which rely on the heteronormative assemblage of masculinity and sexuality. This assemblage, which has assumed spaces of privilege, converges with, affects and is influenced by issues of religion, ethnicity, patriarchy and citizenship. Insistence on performativities of masculinity and men’s sexuality serve to undergird an imagined “Malay-Muslim cohesiveness.” While “non-heteronormative” refers to a gamut of gender identities and sexual expressions that defies gender and sexual conventions, I use it in reference to men whose lives are incongruous with socio-cultural and religio-political endorsements of masculinity and heterosexuality as essentialised and stable traits. Any variation of or divergence from these definitions is unequivocally excoriated as deviant and/or sinful. In queering the aforementioned political agendas, I challenge the normalisations and uncritical acceptance of these intersecting issues, and foreground the lived experiences of non-heteronormative men. My aim is to expose how the imagined Malay-Muslim cohesiveness belies the real intent of political security and power.</p>
<p>The topic of sexuality is one which continues to be held in great sensitivity among many Malaysians. The sexual activities of Malaysian Muslims are often subjected to surveillance and penalties. Religio-political institutions such as <i>Jabatan Kemajuan Islam Malaysia</i> or Department of Islamic Development Malaysia (JAKIM) in the Federal Territory of Kuala Lumpur are assiduous in stampeding on the private sexual lives of Malay-Muslims, irrespective of heterosexual or homosexual expression. In this regard, sexual subjectivities have become unwitting pawns in political strivings. In my work, I specifically focus on two warring Malaysian political parties – the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) and Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party (PAS). UMNO’s presence in the ruling coalition of <i>Barisan Nasional</i> or the National Front (BN) is so formidable that its position in the federal government has eclipsed that of other component parties. History has borne witness to how UMNO and PAS have struggled to “out-Islamise” each other in order for one to wrestle moral authority from the other. Additionally, the efforts of UMNO and PAS to out-Islamise each other are also attempts to “out-Malayise” and “out-Malaysianise” each other. Section 160(2) of the Federal Constitution of Malaysia conflates the ethnic identity of a Malay person with the praxis of the Islamic faith, thus constructing the Malaysian-Malay-Muslim triadic identity. This UMNO-PAS crusade is evidently not embarked upon for gratuitous purposes, as the emergent champion of morality commands greater political credibility.</p>
<p>I wish to highlight three particular areas in which the UMNO-PAS rivalry has unfolded. First, both parties engage in mutual vilification by invalidating each other’s “Islamness.” Second, the competition for moral – and by extension, political – legitimacy has materialised in the Malaysian heteropatriarchal and masculine systems of Islamic family laws. In such religio-legal matters, the ruling UMNO/BN-led government clearly favours Malay-Muslim men, as evident in marriage and paternal rights. Third, UMNO and PAS actively foster the vilification of all non-heteronormative persons, including especially non-heteronormative men. I argue that Malaysian men elicit greater religio-political and socio-cultural capital over women, particularly in Muslim societies. While such a disposition may lead to the imaging of women as subservient to men, it is “manness” in male bodied-persons which claims centre stage. Thus, the imagined “Malay-Muslim cohesiveness” that is built on heteronormative masculinity is crucial for UMNO and PAS as they scramble towards religio-political ascendancy. Heteronormative masculinity becomes the metonym for strength, power, uprightness and religiosity. Conversely, non-heteronormative expressions of gender and sexuality are feminised, and perceived as weakness and subjugation. From this perspective, non-heteronormative Malay-Muslim men become entrapped in ideologies that act as collateral for the UMNO/BN-PAS political rivalries.</p>
<p>Both UMNO and PAS utilise non-heteronormative Malay-Muslim men as slates upon which they inscribe and impose their notions of “Malaysianness,” “Malayness,” “Muslimness,” “maleness” and “appropriate male sexuality.” In this process, each party aspires towards greater fortifications of its political position by referring to itself as the ultimate moral agent in pronouncing judgement on non-heteronormative men. Nonetheless, the visibility of non-heteronormative Malay-Muslim men destabilises the perception of and reliance on heteronormative masculinity and sexuality as the lynchpins of Malay-Muslim cohesiveness, power, stability and ascendancy. Malaysian Malay-Muslim men like writer Azwan Ismail who proclaimed his sexuality on a YouTube video, and Ariff Alfian Rosli who underwent a same-sex civil partnership in Ireland, assume positions as queer agents who threaten the perception that heteronormative sexualities are indispensable for “valid” performativities of religious adherence, citizenship, ethnicity, masculinity and male sexual expression. Both men reject moralistic condemnations of sexual disgust and resist insidious attempts to manipulate them for indiscriminate power acquisitions. They re-appropriate their rightful positions as Malaysian Malay-Muslim men who unapologetically offer and embody alternative performativities of citizenship, the Malay ethnicity, Islam, masculinity and non-heteronormative sexualities in one integrated breath.</p>
