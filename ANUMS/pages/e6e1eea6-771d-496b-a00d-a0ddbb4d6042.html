            <td valign="middle"><p>Welcome to the website of the Economics and Environment
              Network (EEN) at the Australian National University (ANU) in Canberra. It was established in 2002 by the Centre for Resource and
              Environmental Studies (CRES), now part of the Fenner School of Environment and Society,
              to promote collaboration, integration, innovation, learning and research in environmental, ecological
              and resource economics at ANU and more generally in Australia. </p>
              <p>As a network, we have no view on different
                schools of thought or types of specialisation, and our members approach
                their work in many different ways.
                Our only unifying philosophy is that a sound understanding of economic
                principles can often help, and is sometimes crucial, in achieving
                more effective protection and management of our environment and
                natural resources.</p>
              <p> Our members include academic staff and Ph.D students working in
                many different parts of Australia. Together we form the largest
                group of researchers in ecological, natural resource and environmental
                economics in the southern hemisphere.</p>

              <p>EEN provided the foundation for the <a href="http://www.crawford.anu.edu.au/research_units/eerh/">Environmental Economics Research Hub (EERH)</a>,
              located in the Crawford School of Economics and Government during 2007-11, and funded by the Australian Government's Commonwealth Environment Fesearch Facilities (CERF).
              EERH's successes resulted in the development of the current Economics and Environment Network, which comprises three integrated centres:
              the <a href="http://www.acbee.anu.edu.au/">Australian  Centre for Biosecurity and Environmental Economics</a> (<em>AC BEE</em>),
              the <a href="http://ccep.anu.edu.au/">Centre for Climate  Economics and Policy</a> (<em>CCEP</em>), and the
              <a href="http://cweep.anu.edu.au/">Centre for Water Economics, Environment  and Policy</a> (<em>CWEEP</em>).</p><br /></td>
