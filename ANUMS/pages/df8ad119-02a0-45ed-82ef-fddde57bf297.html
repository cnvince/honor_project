This is a project on high performance grid and cluster computing between
<a href="http://www.platform.com">Platform (TM) Computing</a>, the <a
href="http://cs.anu.edu.au">Department of Computer Science</a> at the 
<a href="http://www.anu.edu.au"> Australian National University</a> and
the <a href="http://www.cs.adelaide.edu.au/">Department of Computer
Science</a> at the <a href="http://www.adelaide.edu.au/"> University of
Adelaide</a>. It began in July 2007 and is funded by the  <a
href="http://www.arc.gov.au">ARC</a> Linkage Grant LP0669762 and
Platform (TM) Computing.

<p>

The project's Chief Investigators are <a
href="http://cs.anu.edu.au/~Peter.Strazdins">Dr Peter Strazdins</a>
(ANU) and <a href="http://www.cs.adelaide.edu.au/users/paulc/">Dr Paul
Coddington</a> (Adelaide). Associated Platform staff are  Dr Khalid
Ahmed (Senior Architect), Mr Chris Smith (Principal Product Architect),
and Dr Jingwen Wang (VP Engineering). <p>

The project's APAI PhD scholar is <a
href="http://www.memyviews.com"> Mr Jaison Mulerikkal</a>. <!--<a 
href="#phd">Applications</a> are currently being sought for the 
project's second APAI scholar.-->


<H2> <a name="background">Background</a></H2>

The development of Performance Modelling, Evaluation and Programmability
Issues of Parallel Scientific Applications using Service Oriented
Grid-Oriented  Infrastructures is of chief interest to Platform (TM)
Computing, as is evident from its products such as the Platform LSF
environment for Grids/Clusters, Platform Enterprise Grid Orchestrator
(EGO) grid resource management platform and Platform Symphony
Enterprise Grid package for financial services.   The latter is largely
comprised of the Service Oriented Middleware (SOAM), which provides a
high-level infrastructure for enabling grid services. 

<p>

The SOA approach has worked well for financial applications; this
project will investigate the applicability of this approach to
(scientific and engineering) numerical applications.



<H2><a name="themes">Research Themes</a></H2>

The overall theme is to investigate the applicability of Service
Oriented Middleware (SOAM) to high performance numerical computing.
In particular to:
<ul>
<li> Develop programming models that extend shared memory paradigms such
    as <a href="http://www.openmp.org/">OpenMP</a> to a distributed environment.
<li> Characterize the scientific applications or libraries that can be ported
    to run well on a service-oriented communication infrastructures (SOAM), 
    running in a dynamic (EGO) and static  environment.
<li> Investigate the programmability and optimization of such applications 
    including things such as tracing and debugging tools.
<li> Devise a performance modelling methodology that can predict the
    performance of such applications, and also be used to make run-time
    decisions in a dynamic environment.
</ul>

<H2><a name="phd">APAI_IT PhD Scholarship</a></H2>

<!--One PhD Scholarship is currently available.-->
<p>

<em>Requirements:</em>
Honours I or IIA degree in a computing-related discipline (or
equivalent qualification). Preferable attributes include experience in
any of the following areas: high performance computing, grid computing
MPI programming, complex software systems, scientific computation.
Applicants normally must be Australian citizens or residents or 
New Zealand citizens
to be eligible for ARC-funded APAI_IT scholarships.
<!--Exceptional international applicants may be considered, but it must be noted
that the APAI_IT scholarships cover living expenses only and not tuition fees.
-->

<p>

<em> Benefits</em>: APAI_IT PhD scholarship stipend ($25,627 pa) +
relocation costs, visits to Platform (Toronto) and an internship at
Platform (Beijing). Opportunities for cross-institutional studies at the
University of Adelaide. APAI_IT stipends are over 3 years, extendable up
to 3.5 years. 

<p>

<!--<em>Application:</em> 
interested candidates should contact CI Strazdins first.
A CV, scan/photocopy of academic transcript and the names and contact
details of three referees will then be sought. Samples of written work
(thesis, reports, papers or codes) will also be helpful. Applicants at
this stage should also begin to develop a 1-2 page research proposal
based one or more of the above <a href="#themes">research themes</a>, 
in consultation with the Project CIs. 
The links at the bottom of this page may be useful (note:
this proposal is not binding; its purpose is to demonstrate the
applicant's understanding of the field). 
<p>

A formal PhD application should reach <a
href="http://www.anu.edu.au/graduate/prospective/research.php">ANU</a>
as soon as practicable. Note that written referee reports
are required with  (or soon after) the formal application.  Applications
will be considered until all APAI_IT  positions are filled.  The commencement
date should be by 31st March.
