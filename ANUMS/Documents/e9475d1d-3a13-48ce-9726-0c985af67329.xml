A range of e-hub&apos;s programs have explored the importance and quality of health information on the Internet, and the use of the Internet for disseminating public health information on mental health.Affordable Solar EnergyANU Centre for Sustainable Energy Systems researchers are working with leading Australia-US solar solution company Chromasun to develop the next generation of solar energy innovation. They are joined in the partnership by CSIRO, the University of New South Wales and NEP Solar. The Australian Solar Institute granted $3.3 million to support the work. Together, the consortium is helping find solutions for some of the problems that have prevented the widespread rollout of hybrid solar-thermal systems, which harness the sun&apos;s energy to create electricity, and, heat and power air conditioning.  The new Micro-Concentrator unit developed by the group solves the market acceptance issues with its highly efficient, low-profile, light, easy to install and aesthetically pleasing design. The amount of useful energy that can be obtained from a limited roof area with this technology is superior to traditional photovoltaic or thermal systems and will significantly reduce the impact on a building&apos;s aesthetics.New Treatment for Diabetes Type 1Diabetes represents a significant and growing world-wide health issue with the annual international market for diabetes therapeutics nearing $30 billion. Beta Therapeutics Pty Ltd, an ANU spin-off company, was founded to drive the commercial development of a diabetes treatment based on ANU research and intellectual property. The research, conducted by Professor Chris Parish, Dr Charmaine Simeonovic and their research teams at the ANU John Curtin School of Medical Research, has led to the discovery of a novel, critical mechanism of diabetes disease progression. This discovery led to the development of a unique therapeutic strategy and drug target for the treatment of diabetes. Pre-clinical studies have defined a new class of therapeutics that uniquely spare insulin-producing pancreatic islets cells in laboratory models of type 1 diabetes. Treatment with such therapeutics has been shown to modulate diabetes severity, enhance islet viability and prevent the onset of diabetes. viewcount:0 Time:null</string>
