   <string>Richard Shing, Archaeologist, Vanuatu Cultural Centre, gives this lecture entitled &apos;Archaeological research and community collaboration and participation in the Republic of Vanuatu&apos; at The Australian National University on 23 March 2012.At the close of the Lapita Conference in New Caledonia in 2002, indigenous archaeologists saw that there was a clear need to further promote archaeology more broadly at a community level, to create a wider awareness and understanding for all Pacific Islanders, young and old, of what archaeology involved, what it tries to achieve, along with its associated implications. For a long time Pacific Islanders have been wary of archaeology, often associating it with grave digging, a practice that of course in many Pacific cultures, is considered sacrilegious. Over the last 15 years the Vanuatu Cultural Centre (VCC), in collaboration with a number of foreign researchers, and guided by the Vanuatu Cultural Centre&apos;s research policy, has been running an active program of increasing public awareness in relation to archaeology. This has involved such activities as running training workshops for Vanuatu&apos;s fieldworkers, school tours of excavations often including some level of participation, mounting exhibitions, producing publications in the three national languages (booklets, posters and comic books) and regular features on national TV, radio and newspapers. Through these collaborative awareness programs, an increasing number of Ni-Vanuatu are gaining a much greater appreciation of archaeology and its potential to contribute to a better understanding of our country&apos;s 3000 year history. viewcount:0 Time:null</string>
