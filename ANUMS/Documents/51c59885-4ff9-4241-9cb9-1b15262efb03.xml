   <string>Professor Patrick Troy AO gives this lecture entitled &apos;Accommodating Australians: Commonwealth Government involvement in housing&apos; at The Australian National University. This video was recorded on 19 June 2012.Professor Troy&apos;s new book, Accommodating Australians,  explores the rise and fall of public housing since the 1940s when the Australian government resolved, in the aftermath of the Depression, in the bleakest years of World War II, to improve the quality of housing and to make it more affordable.It describes the Commonwealth post-war reconstruction initiatives to increase the stock of public housing, to improve its design, and the efficiency of the building industry. It shows the way in which these initiatives led the States to reverse their approaches to the provision of urban infrastructure services. Price inflation is fuelled as principles and rational development give way to a pre-occupation with the short term wishes of developers.Professor Patrick Troy AO is an Emeritus Professor at the Fenner School of Environment &amp; Society, ANU. He has worked as an engineer and planner in State and local government, as senior administrator in the Commonwealth and as a research academic at the ANU for 44 years. He has published 15 books and many papers on housing, infrastructure, transport, urban planning and development and on energy and water consumption. This book is part of his exploration of the suburbanisation of Australian cities and their vulnerability. viewcount:0 Time:null</string>
