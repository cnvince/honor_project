   <string>In this public lecture world-renowned China scholar Professor David Shambaugh publicly discusses for the first time the main findings and principal arguments of his forthcoming book China Goes Global: The Partial Power. Contrary to the conventional wisdom, Shambaugh finds that China is a &apos;partial power&apos; (its growing global footprint is broad but not deep), that China is far from becoming a global superpower, and that Beijing possesses little global influence. David Shambaugh is an internationally recognised authority and author on contemporary China and the international relations of Asia. He is Professor of Political Science and International Affairs and the founding Director of the China Policy Program in the Elliott School of International Affairs at George Washington University. He is also a Nonresident Senior Fellow in the Foreign Policy Studies Program and Center for Northeast Asian Policy Studies at The Brookings Institution. viewcount:0 Time:null</string>
