   <string>Samuel Francis is a PhD candidate from the Centre for Gravitational Physics at The Australian National University. His research focuses on laser interferometry for the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment Follow-On (GRACE FO) NASA/German mission. In this video Samuel explains the weak-light phase locking experiment that he completed for his Engineering Honours project. GRACE FO, a space-based interferometer will require optical signals to be tracked over hundreds of kilometres. GRACE FO will use lasers transmitted between spacecraft to measure displacements at the sub micron level. This is achieved by measuring the lasers&apos; phase difference as it varies by millions of wavelengths as the light travels between spacecraft. Due to diffraction losses over the large distances the beams must travel between spacecraft only a fraction of the laser power is detected. This leads to a major challenge in these types of measurements: as the signal power decreases, the signal-to-noise reduces and measuring the phase of an optical signal becomes difficult as the phase detector becomes prone to cycle slips, non-deterministic jumps in phase by whole cycles.This video discusses the use of independently stabilised lasers to reduce the probability of cycle slips. The goal is to achieve optical phase locking to sub-fW signals. viewcount:0 Time:null</string>
