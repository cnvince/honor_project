            <p class="bodyText">The role of the military in South Korean politics poses some interesting questions for the
               			study of civil-military relations in developing societies. The military has dominated Korean politics for an
               			unusually long period of time &#8211; nearly thirty years. On the other hand, recent trends towards
               			democracy in Korea appear to be more deeply entrenched historically than in many other recently democratised
               			polities, especially those in Latin America. This chapter attempts to clarify some more obvious issues
               			related to these characteristics of civil-military relations and democratic transition in South Korea
               			(hereafter Korea). Specific issues to be addressed include: the nature of the political system after
               			independence which provided a structural framework for the military&#8217;s political dominance; the
               			internal characteristics of the military, reflecting and interacting with the overall political structure,
               			which induced military officers to assume supreme power in Korean political economy; the reasons for the
               			eventual demise of military rule and the beginning of civilian control of the military; and future prospects
               			for democracy in Korea and the military&#8217;s role in it.
            </p>
            <p class="bodyText">Methodologically, a distinction may be drawn between structural and motivational factors
               			in explaining the complex phenomenon of civil-military relations. The former help explain overall trends in
               			civil-military relations; the latter are relevant to the more specific behavior of political actors. In this
               			chapter, we will concentrate on structural factors, especially those affecting the balance of power between
               			the military and civilian sectors, because our interest is in overall patterns of civil-military relations
               			rather than specific political events.
