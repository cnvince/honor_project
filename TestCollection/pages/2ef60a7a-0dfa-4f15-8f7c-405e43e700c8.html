    <p>One of nature’s most fascinating phenomena is the collective behaviour of animals. A shoal of fish, a swarm of locusts, and a colony of ants can all act as superorganisms, where the group as a whole makes collective decisions.</p>

<p>Equally interesting are smaller groups that also have this peculiar behaviour, such as a flock of migratory birds that forms a “V” in the sky. Researchers have observed and studied this particular grouping of animals for many decades, yet little is known about their social structure. Do they have leaders? If so, are their roles similar to humans in anyway?</p>

<p>The lack of understanding of this behaviour intrigued Máté Nagy, a zoologist at University of Oxford. He thought that studying at least one species may shed light on the occurrence of this behaviour in the rest of the animal kingdom, including humans.</p>

<p>In a paper published in the <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1305552110">Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</a>, Nagy and his colleagues studied the behaviour of domestic pigeons (<em>Columba livia</em>). Their aim was to study social dominance in one task and use the results to analyse the behaviour of leaders (if there were any) in a new task.</p>

<p><a href="https://c479107.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/files/28006/area14mp/9twrqw48-1374679771.jpg"></a>
      One of Nagy’s pigeon with the coloured barcode. Zsuzsa Akos</p>

<p>For this, they tagged three groups of ten pigeons with a barcode and programmed computers to follow the movements of these pigeons using a video feed. In the first task, designed to study social dominance, the three groups of pigeons were left with a feeding cup. The group tracked three types of behaviour: feeding-queueing (a measure of an individual’s access to food), approach-avoidance (a measure of the interactions between individuals) and pecking order (measure of aggression displayed through fighting and chasing).</p>

<p>After some number-crunching that took the three types of behaviour into consideration, the simple feeding task showed that a social hierarchy existed among pigeons. Nagy was able use that data to identify the socially dominant individuals within each group.</p>

<p>Next, each group was let free so that Nagy could determine if the socially dominant pigeons took on the job of leaders when the pigeons flew as a flock. This time, the pigeons were fitted with a GPS tracker, which allowed Nagy to track the positions of each individual relative to the rest of the flock.</p>

<p>Here Nagy found that the leaders in flock-flying were different from those that were socially dominant during the feeding exercise. These results are unlike what you would see with gray wolves or chacma baboons, where the socially dominant individual may also lead the group. The leaders did have some common features, though. The socially dominant individuals were more aggressive than average flock member and had a comparatively larger body.</p>

<p>Because of the complications involved in flock-flying, it is possible that a somewhat less aggressive, and possibly better informed individual takes the leading position. However, there was no relation between leadership and age, so it wasn’t that the more experienced flyers lead the flock.</p>

<p>Nagy’s results are not completely surprising. Similar behaviour has been observed among <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003347211000960">meerkats</a> and <a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0036567">mosquito fish</a>, where, depending on the context, hierarchies in the group change. But this is the first time it has been observed in birds.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Nagy’s results will push other animal behaviourists to try to answer other intriguing questions: What qualities predispose an individual to be a leader? Are those best suited to making a decision also those that lead? And how, if at all, do animal results translate into understanding human behaviour?</p>

    <p>Vitamin D has emerged as “the vitamin of the decade”, with a long and growing list of maladies supposedly caused through its absence or prevented through its bountiful supply.</p>

<p>But is there adequate evidence for the wonders claimed for vitamin D or are we getting a bit carried away?</p>

<p>Before you answer that, here are some common misconceptions about vitamin D that you should know about.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Everybody knows their vitamin D level should be above …?</p>

<p>It’s a fairly universal agreement that a blood concentration of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (the usual measure of vitamin D status) below 25 nanomoles/litre (nmol/L) should be considered a serious deficiency.</p>

<p>Anyone who is tested and returns results like that needs to talk to their doctor about proper management. But knowing what levels are sufficient is trickier.</p>

<p>In 2010, the <a href="http://www.iom.edu/Reports/2010/Dietary-Reference-Intakes-for-calcium-and-vitamin-D.aspx">Institute of Medicine</a> in the United States concluded that bone health is the only condition for which there’s an established causal association with vitamin D. They found:</p>

<p>health benefits beyond bone health — benefits often reported in the media — were from studies that provided often mixed and inconclusive results and could not be considered reliable.</p>

<p>So there’s clearly contention about how much is enough. A level of 50nmol/L is sufficient to optimise the bone health of the majority of the population. But other groups recommend 75nmol/L, <a href="http://www.vitamindcouncil.org/about-vitamin-d/testing-for-vitamin-d/">100nmol/L or higher</a> (note that US sites provide recommendations in nanograms per millilitre or ng/ml  – multiply by 2.5 to convert to nmol/L).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There’s a vitamin D deficiency epidemic in Australia.</p>

<p>Actually, what is most clear is that there’s an epidemic of vitamin D testing in Australia – a <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23794593">94-fold</a> increase from 2000 to 2010. Costs to Medicare have gone from $1.3 million in 2000/2001 to <a href="https://www.medicareaustralia.gov.au/statistics/mbs_item.shtml">$140.5 million in 2012/2013.</a></p>

<p> Rather than an epidemic of deficiency, there’s currently an epidemic of vitamin D testing in Australia. Shutterstock</p>

<p>Some populations are clearly at risk of vitamin D deficiency. People who habitually cover their skin while in public for cultural or other reasons, for instance, and the immobile elderly who are rarely sun exposed. But the evidence of population-wide vitamin D deficiency is thin and unconvincing, at least in part because vitamin D tests are problematic and the desired level is hotly debated.</p>

<p>If an unreliable test is used and the “sufficient” bar is set too high and more people are tested, then vitamin D “deficiency” will seem more common.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A vitamin D test gives a simple answer and is accurate and reliable.</p>

<p> This is definitely not so.</p>

<p>If you take blood from one person and split it up into several samples and test these, you can get very different results between the samples. And it’s not just a little bit different.</p>

<p>A recent Australian study assessing the consistency and accuracy of <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21395958">vitamin D tests</a> found that between one-in-five and one-in-three participants were misclassified as “deficient”.  The vitamin D test results for a single blood sample returned enormously different results depending on which type of test was used and where the sample was analysed.</p>

<p>Four samples (out of approximately 800) differed by more than 100nmol/L (that’s double the usual “sufficient” level of 50nmol/L) across two different tests, and 10% of the results differed by more than 50nmol/L. These are different measurements of the same sample!</p>

<p>Fortunately work is underway to improve this abysmal situation. A group of international agencies are developing a reference measurement procedure and laboratories will be able to assess the performance of their test against this new standard.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Vitamin D is the elixir of life, which is sometimes presented as vitamin D deficiency will kill us all.</p>

<p>Given the challenges of accurately measuring levels of this vitamin and the disagreement on where the goalposts are, doing good consistent research to determine the benefits and detriments of high or low vitamin D is pretty difficult.</p>

<p>There’s no doubt that severe vitamin D deficiency causes rickets in children, and an equivalent condition known as osteomalacia in adults. Old pictures of children with bowed legs or knock knees were often of children with rickets.</p>

<p>And there’s pretty good evidence that supplementation with vitamin D <em>and</em> calcium, in combination with weight-bearing exercise, can decrease the risks of fractures in the elderly. Particularly in people who have low levels of vitamain D or calcium (or both) before starting supplementation.</p>

<p>But most evidence for the other reported benefits of vitamin D comes from weak studies, and there’s little support from better studies.</p>

<p>There’s good evidence that supplementation with vitamin D and calcium, in combination with weight-bearing exercise, can decrease the risks of fractures in the elderly. Shutterstock</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Given it is such good stuff, the higher my vitamin D level, the better.</p>

<p>Vitamin D has traditionally been thought to be safe, requiring very high levels (greater than 400nmol/L) to reach toxicity. This toxicity cannot occur through sun exposure, but can through excessive supplementation.</p>

<p>But as we delve more into the vitamin D story, studies are <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23666975">reporting risks to health</a>  at even modestly high levels, such as 80-100nmol/L.</p>

<p>The evidence is not yet strong (much like the evidence of vitamin D’s benefits) but this type of association is typical of many vitamins and nutrients, where both <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23609334">too little and too much are bad for you</a> .</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sunscreen stops vitamin D production.</p>

<p>The majority of vitamin D your body needs comes through exposure to the sun, specifically from shorter wavelength UVB radiation that is also the main cause of skin cancers. It may seem logical that if sunscreen stops the damaging UVB reaching sensitive skin cells, it will also stop vitamin D production by those same cells.</p>

<p>But even if sunscreen is applied very thickly, vitamin D production is reduced but not stopped. And, of course, who puts it on that thickly?</p>

<p>Most of us apply sunscreen because we are going to be in the sun. We put on a thin layer that is not too icky. Under these conditions, <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7726582">sunscreen actually doesn’t seem to make a lot of difference</a> to vitamin D production.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>There’s a lot we don’t know about vitamin D. But we do know that Australia has the highest skin cancer incidence in the world: hundreds of thousands of skin cancers are removed each year at a cost of <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=sinclair+r+nmsc">more than $700 million</a>  and there are over <a href="http://www.aihw.gov.au/acim-books/">2,000 deaths</a> from it.</p>

<p>Excessive sun exposure is the <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15753968">main cause of that problem</a>. Getting the balance between vitamin D levels and sun protection right is an important health goal.</p>

<p>More research is needed and it should be Australian research because our circumstances are different to those in the United States and Europe. We can’t just take results from there and use them here.</p>

<p>While a <a href="https://theconversation.com/theres-a-very-simple-solution-to-your-lack-of-vitamin-d-15409">simple solution</a> would be nice, an evidence-based one is preferable and worth pursuing. Stories about our epidemic of vitamin D deficiency drive excessive testing at high cost and unknown value. And they probably just end up selling more vitamin supplements.</p>

<p>But they also <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3705326/pdf/nutrients-05-00915.pdf">create confusion</a> and diminish people’s confidence and resolve to reduce excessive UV exposure.</p>

<p>While federal election watchers will be avidly fixed on the Reserve Bank of Australia’s decision to alter the cash rate decision today, economists are more interested in global factors and signs of weakness in the domestic economy.</p>

<p>The outlook for the global economy continues to look uncertain; it appears as though only the US economy has potential to surprise on the upside.</p>

<p>Domestically, the unemployment rate is edging up. Inflation is currently well contained but as the Australian dollar has continued to depreciate, there are concerns in the medium term that this will put upward pressure on inflation due to higher import prices.  However, in the near-term the stimulus from the lower dollar and the historically low cash rate has yet to be fully transmitted to the real economy.</p>

<p>The consensus of the nine shadow board members for keeping the cash rate unchanged at 2.75 percent has dropped from nearly 70% in July to 47% in August. Members are nearly 40% confident that a reduction of the cash rate by 25 basis points is the most appropriate policy.</p>

<p>The shift towards a rate cut clearly shows up at the six-month horizon: the probability that rates will need to rise in the next six months has dropped from 30% to 25%, while the probability that rates ought to be lower than the current rate has increased to 50%. A year out, the shadow board members continue to attach about a 45% probability to the need for an increase in the cash rate and approximately a 40% probability to the need for a decrease in the cash rate.</p>

<p><em>The Shadow Board is a project by the Centre for Applied Macroeconomic Analysis, based at the ANU, which asks industry and academic economists what interest rate the Reserve Bank of Australia should set.</em></p>

<p><em>The project is designed to test and improve transparency of central bank deliberations by revealing the opinions of individual members, emphasising the underlying macroeconomic uncertainties.</em></p>

<p><strong>Paul Bloxham, Chief Economist (Australia and New Zealand), HSBC Bank Australia Ltd:</strong></p>

<p>Inflation is comfortably in the lower half of the target band and even though the recent decline in the Australian dollar should be expected to see a pick‐up in imported goods prices, the current looseness of the labour market is likely to keep wages pressures at bay. Growth is also a bit below trend, with low rates still only getting significant traction in the housing market. Given low inflation and below trend growth the RBA could consider cutting rates a bit further. I recommend the cash rate is cut by 25 basis points to 2.50%.</p>

<p>My medium-term view for rates has shifted a bit, however, reflecting the recent depreciation of the Australian dollar. With the dollar now at a lower level, inflation should be expected to rise modestly in coming quarters, which may start to limit the extent to which further rate cuts can be delivered.</p>

<p>The outlook for the AUD is critical in this regard and is, of course, highly dependent on offshore developments. There are growing signs that the US economy is recovering and as a result the Federal Reserve may begin to slow its asset purchase program soon. This would put downward pressure on the AUD which could deliver more inflation in Australia.</p>

<p>With the economy currently operating below capacity this inflationary impulse would not be a concern as it is unlikely to see rising wage pressures. However, if local growth does start to pick up soon, the upside risks to inflation may start to emerge, limiting the scope for rate cuts and perhaps implying that rates may have to start heading back towards neutral.</p>

<p><strong>Mark Crosby, Associate Professor, Melbourne Business School:</strong></p>

<p>There are further signs of weakening in the local economy and mixed signals from global economies. However, recent rate cuts would be yet to have their full effect on the local economy, suggesting a “wait and see” approach rather than cutting this month, particularly given helpful weakness in the AUD. In future months the global outlook is still very uncertain, with equal probability of ongoing recovery and slowdown arising from any of a number of key countries.</p>

<p><strong>Warwick McKibbin, Chair in Public Policy in the ANU Centre for Applied Macroeconomic Analysis (CAMA) in the Crawford School of Public Policy at the Australian National University:</strong></p>

<p>Although there are clear signs of a change in the drivers of growth in the economy as the resources boom enters a new phase, reducing interest rates any further will do more to misallocate capital than they will stimulate demand. The problem is that fiscal policy through tax changes and infrastructure spending and direct reforms to enhance productivity will do more to rebalance the economy over time than monetary policy can.</p>

<p>The question to be addressed is that without the correct policies elsewhere in the economy, should monetary policy fill the void? My view is that it should not, especially when interest rates have hit such low levels and there is a real danger from the misallocation of capital causing bigger problems over future years. For example, housing pricing have been rising since the trough in May 2012 when you would expected weakness in asset prices as expected income growth drops from the resources boom. Low interest rates are driving asset prices higher than fundamentals. Trying to raise demand from cutting interest rates does not induce investment, especially when weak confidence driven by political incoherence is a driving force in the current Australian economy.</p>

<p><strong>James Morley, Professor, University of New South Wales, CAMA:</strong></p>

<p>Policy should remain accommodative for now, but with an eye on inflation expectations.</p>

<p>Headline inflation in Q2 was 2.4% on a year‐on‐year basis, which is safely within the RBA’s target range. Meanwhile, labour market conditions remain lacklustre, with the unemployment rate creeping up to 5.7% in June.</p>

<p>These domestic conditions provide scope for the RBA to cut the policy rate further, which they will most likely do at the next meeting in response to a weakening outlook for China.</p>

<p>However, it should be emphasised that past cuts in the policy rate are already having their impact on bringing the Australian dollar back towards its long‐run level and this will likely trigger headline inflation to run near the top of the RBA’s target range in the near term. So it is essential that RBA policy focuses on keeping inflation expectations anchored during this period of adjustment in the dollar back to its long‐run level. Also, partially compensating weakness in China, the outlook for the US economy is improving.</p>

<p>Given this background, I continue to believe that real interest rates are already sufficiently low and will need to return to neutral within the next 18 months or so. However, I put more weight than last month on the need for interest rates to remain at these low levels in the coming months due to the weakness in China and the need for a shift in economic activity from mining to other sectors.</p>

<p><strong>Jeffrey Sheen, Professor and Head of Department of Economics, Macquarie University, Editor, The Economic Record, CAMA:</strong></p>

<p>The June 2013 Australian labour force figures show a rise in the unemployment rate to 5.7%, but that was due to a rise in participation. CPI inflation remains benign. Business confidence in Australia is stronger in 2013 than 2012. The nominal trade‐ weighted exchange rate has depreciated 12.3% since March 2013, but the real trade‐weighted exchange rate has only depreciated by 2% so far – therefore more time is needed to see what will happen to the real exchange rate. Given these facts, my recommendations are unchanged from last month.</p>

    <p>A sherpa, a sous sherpa and a yak walk into a troika meeting.  Alas, this is not the beginning of a shaggy dog joke, it is a normal description of a Group of 20 (G20) process. Arcane and obscure terminology are the order of the day for a G20 Summit, which is the natural consequence of letting an international forum be designed by finance officials.</p>

<p>But fear not, over the course of several posts, we will guide you through what the G20 is, what you need to know about it, what is being decided in St Petersburg in early September and why everyone in Brisbane should move to Noosa in late 2014 when the <a href="http://www.choosebrisbane.com/Stories/G20%20Leaders%20Summit.aspx">G20 Leaders Summit rolls into Brisbane</a> next November.</p>

<p>But you do need to know.  Australians need to pay attention to what has happened in the tangled world of international financial regulation since the G20 burst onto the scene in 2008.  We are part of this leadership group, so we had better <a href="http://www.lowyinstitute.org/news-and-media/videos/conversation-why-hosting-g20-important-australia">do our best</a>, and be clear about what the Australian Government is committing us to.</p>

<p>The G20 <a href="http://www.g20.org/docs/about/g20_en.html">describes itself</a> as “the premier forum for international cooperation on the most important issues of the global economic and financial agenda”.</p>

<p>The G20 brings together leaders, finance ministers and central bank governors from 19 countries in a series of meetings. The countries are Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Turkey, the United Kingdom, the United States of America, plus the European Union, which is represented by the President of the European Council and by the Head of the European Central Bank.</p>

<p>The host gets five extra invitations, but Spain is always one of these as a “permanent guest”. Usually, the chair of ASEAN and the African Union get invited. The heads of the International Monetary Fund, the OECD and World Bank also come, and some UN chiefs.</p>

<p>So there are lots of questions already.  You can see the G8 countries are all there. You can also see the rising economies are there, often called the “BRICS” – Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa. The G20 is not necessarily the 19 richest nations in any given year, on a GDP or on a per capita basis. The G8 were asked to invite counterparts from a number of “systemically important countries” from regions around the world to make a <em>more</em> representative body.</p>

<p>The G20 is <a href="http://futureun.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Briefing-3-Ramesh-Thakur-G20.pdf">outside</a> the United Nations system.  G20 declarations do not bind any other nation, or even each other except for peer pressure. No one voted these countries to be economic leaders, unlike the Security Council which has five permanent members (US, Russia, China, France and UK), and then an elaborate election system for the other ten seats.</p>

<p>Australia had to wage and win a long campaign in order to be elected for two years from 2013-2014 to deal with threats to international peace and security.  The G20 is more like a discussion group, with a <a href="http://www.g20.org/docs/g20_russia/priorities.html">big, flexible agenda</a>.  Questions about its membership and legitimacy are ongoing.</p>

<p>So why does everyone care so much about the G20? Well, as <a href="http://www.dfat.gov.au/trade/g20/">DFAT</a> puts it:</p>

<p>“G20 members account for 85% of the world economy, 80% of global trade, and two-thirds of the world’s population. The G20 represents all geographic regions of the world, but remains small enough to be an effective decision-making body.”</p>

<p>So when the world was facing a financial crisis, the G20 was seen as nimble enough to do some crisis management. More of that in future posts.</p>

<p>There is no secretariat either, unlike the UN.  The G20 works on a troika system, where the previous host, the current host and the country about to host share organising duties. So Australia (2014 host) is part of the troika with Mexico (2012) and Russia (2013), and later this year, Turkey will join as the 2015 host.</p>

<p>There are lots and lots of meetings leading up to the Leaders Summit.  Before the G20 summit in Brisbane from 15-16 November, there will be two big meetings of the finance ministers and treasurers, the first of which will be held in Sydney on February 22 and 23 and the second in Cairns on September 20 and 21. Not to mention all kinds of satellite meetings, which we will unpack for you over coming weeks.</p>

<p>The glue of the whole process is the sherpas, who lead the “sherpa track” negotiations. The sherpa is the personal representative of the leader, in our case, the Prime Minister, helping them to reach the summit (boom tish). The Australian sherpa since 2010 has been Dr Gordon de Brouwer PSM, Associate Secretary (Domestic Policy Group), Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet of Australia. The sous sherpa and yak are senior public officials helping the sherpa or the Finance Minister. So the Leaders Meeting is crucial to fostering the political support necessary to coordinate and solve problems that cross state borders, like corporate tax evasion.  But public officials are also crucial to the long-term development of the G20 as an institution, and problems that take a long time to fix.</p>

<p>So the G20 aims to promote:</p>

<ul>
<li>policy coordination between its members in order to achieve global economic stability, and sustainable balanced growth</li>
<li>financial regulations that reduce risks and prevent future financial crises</li>

  <div class="feed-item-body">
    <p>As we approach the Australian federal election, trade minister Richard Marles recently confirmed Australia <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/business/marles-vows-not-to-cave-to-us-pressure-20130714-2py8r.html">will not sign the Trans Pacific Partnership Trade Agreement</a> if it includes an investor-state dispute clause.  Marles' stance against this threat to our domestic sovereignty is a critical policy difference between the country’s major parties – the Coalition is <a href="http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/WO1307/S00294/liblab-divide-on-trans-pacific-trade-issues-deplored.htm">more open to agreeing to such a clause</a>.</p>

<p>An investor-state dispute clause gives foreign corporations greater rights than local business to seek compensation off-shore for any Australian legislation or policy decision that undercuts investments. Such a clause was used to challenge our constitutionally valid tobacco plain packing <a href="https://theconversation.com/an-affront-to-the-rule-of-law-international-tribunals-to-decide-on-plain-packaging-8968">legislation</a>. Australia’s trade policy also requires gradual withdrawal from such obligations under bilateral investment treaties.</p>

<p>Whatever the outcome of the election, Australia’s current position against excess investor rights in the trade agreement is principled but precarious. Indeed, many remember how the Howard Government’s “iron clad” assurance our <a href="http://inside.org.au/lessons-from-the-australia%E2%80%93us-free-trade-agreement/">Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme would not be in the Australia-US free trade agreement</a> eventually buckled under intense US pressure.</p>

Australia’s precarious energy security

<p>The issue is particularly important given Kevin Rudd has put energy market reform at the top of his <a href="https://theconversation.com/energy-reform-key-to-productivity-paves-way-for-carbon-action-16029">policy agenda</a>.</p>

<p>The Australian economy depends on coal for export earnings and electricity generation. Further, more than 75% of our economic activities (particularly transport of people and products) are powered by imported crude oil and petroleum fuels.</p>

<p>These have long global supply chains subject to geopolitical instability, and are affected by <a href="http://www.bree.gov.au/publications/aeta.html">decreasing Australian domestic refining capacity</a>.</p>

<p>Yet, despite such fuel imports creating a trade deficit of A$18 billion, Australia’s current energy policy is <a href="http://www.ret.gov.au/energy/facts/white_paper/Pages/energy_white_paper.aspx">against self sufficiency</a>. Indeed, Australia is one of the few developed nations that <a href="http://www.ret.gov.au/energy/energy_security/national_energy_security_assessment/Pages/NationalEnergySecurityAssessment.aspx">lacks a standard stockpile of fuel reserves</a>.</p>

<p>This means that if fuel supplies were cut, Australian motorists <a href="http://www.mynrma.com.au/about/media/australias-liquid-fuel-security-report.htm">would be without petrol in three days and most food and medicine deliveries in a week</a>.</p>

We need stronger public interest energy regulation

<p>Reducing our economic dependence on carbon-based fuels will require new major legislative and policy initiatives by Australian governments. One such policy is a <a href="http://www.miningaustralia.com.au/news/floating-carbon-price-not-good-enough-for-mining-i">floating price on carbon</a>, designed to divert investment to sustainable zero carbon energy.</p>

<p>Another example is a federal regulatory <a href="http://www.klgates.com/water-trigger-becomes-a-reality-for-coal-mining-and-coal-seam-gas-developments-07-04-2013/">“trigger” on coal seam (but not shale) gas or coal mining</a> activities which affect water systems.</p>

<p>Policy could also better secure public revenue derived from sources such as state mining royalties (based on volume) and the <a href="http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/opinion/royalties-shield-miners-from-mrrt-super-profit-tax/story-fnciil7d-1226504236857">federal mining super profits tax</a> (based on profits). Reforms similarly might focus on preventing <a href="http://www.treasury.gov.au/ConsultationsandReviews/Submissions/2013/Taxation-of-Multinational-Enterprises">profit shifting to low tax jurisdictions</a> by foreign energy investors.</p>

<p>Rapid deployment of sustainable energy technologies (such as <a href="https://theconversation.com/artificial-photosynthesis-could-extend-rights-to-nature-15380">artificial photosynthesis</a>) will also require significant government subsidies or incentives. A meeting to discuss such policies among the leaders of the national artificial photosynthesis projects is being sponsored by the UK Royal Society in July 2014.</p>

<p>All of this policy support for sustainable energy systems could be compromised if US TPPA negotiators eventually undermine Australia’s position against excess investor rights.</p>

Greater rights for foreign energy investors than Australian businesses

<p>In other jurisdictions, such excess investor rights have been used by an American natural gas company after the Quebec provincial government imposed a moratorium on coal seam “fracking”. Likewise, when Germany tried to phase out nuclear energy, similar investor claims were initiated by the Vattenfall Group under the <a href="http://www.encharter.org/index.php?id=28">Energy Charter Treaty</a>.</p>

<p>Former Trade Minister Emerson has <a href="http://rabble.ca/blogs/bloggers/council-canadians/2013/04/nafta-challenge-to-fracking-ban-reason-to-avoid-investor-st">warned</a> that such excess investor rights could give foreign energy corporations the right to seek compensation if any of our states sought to regulate their coal seam gas developments.</p>

<p>Apart from undermining the sovereignty of a democratic nation, there is strong evidence from the <a href="http://www.pc.gov.au/projects/study/trade-agreements">Productivity Commission</a>, researchers involved with the <a href="http://www.wto.org/english/res_e/reser_e/ersd201013_e.pdf">World Trade Organisation</a> and <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1015083">other institutions</a> that allowing such excess foreign investor rights does not encourage additional investment where a nation already has a non-corrupt legal system that doesn’t discriminate between domestic and foreign corporations.</p>

Alternatives to excess energy investor rights

<p>Rather than handing over more rights to foreign energy corporations than local businesses, the Trans Pacific Partnership Trade Agreement should allow us to legislate to ensure these organisations pay proper tax, do not commit fraud and are committed to building a responsible energy industry in Australia.</p>

<p>The agreement, for example, could establish working groups to explore development of anti-corporate fraud and <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/national/tax-crackdown-has-to-be-global-20130723-2qhj1.html">fair taxation systems</a> with particular significance for economically significant areas such as energy supply.</p>

<p>Australia is ready to lead the way here. The Federal Attorney General’s Department is awaiting approval to draft legislation implementing key aspects of the <a href="http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R40785.pdf">United States False Claims Act</a>. This would allow informants on energy fraud to be represented by their own legal team (on a “no-win-no-fee” basis) in <a href="http://www.falseclaimsact.com/common-types-of-fraud/energy-fraud">conjunction with government law enforcement officials</a>. If energy fraud is proven, the informant’s team is compensated with 15-30% of the triple damages the government receives.</p>

<p>In California such legislation has been used to catch mining companies that have <a href="http://oag.ca.gov/cfs/falseclaims">filed false reports</a> to conceal the theft of natural resources and <a href="http://www.crowell.com/Practices/False-Claims-Act/articles/False-Claims-Act-Developments-Crowell-Moring-Mining-Law-Monitor#.UeNORhyRO6c">avoid paying royalties</a> under relatively under-analysed ‘reverse-false claims actions’. Similar claims have recovered damages where oil and gas companies <a href="http://www.gibsondunn.com/publications/pages/2012MidYear-FalseClaimsActUpdate.aspx">underpaid royalties</a> owed on natural gas produced from federal and Indian leases].</p>

<p>By holding the line against excess foreign investor rights, Australia will set the preconditions for long-term, socially responsive energy trade and investment in an Asian region committed to the rule of law. The issue divides the major parties in the coming election.</p>
