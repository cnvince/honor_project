				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Date: </strong>18-19 July 2013<br />
<strong>Location:</strong> Hedley Bull Theatres 1 &amp; 2,<br />
The Australian National University</p>
<p>This is a free event</p>
<p><span style="font-family: tahoma">Please register here (<a href="http://archanth.anu.edu.au/events/childhoods-in-south-asia">http://archanth.anu.edu.au/events/childhoods-in-south-asia</a>)</span></p>
<p><em>Childhoods in South Asia: Contemporary and Historical Perspectives </em>provides an interdisciplinary platform for scholars and <abbr title="Non Government Organisation">NGO</abbr> representatives who work in the areas of childhood and education in South Asia. In response to adult speculation and debates around political, social and economic development, we invite critical interrogation of changing conceptions of childhood. While there is increasing theoretical and development interest in children in South Asia, children’s experiences and perspectives are still underrepresented in political, social and economic debate. This interdisciplinary conference seeks to foreground children’s experiences in light of changing conceptual discourses of childhood in historical and contemporary South Asia. While acknowledging the ways children are situated within structures of power, the conference will focus on South Asian children’s stories and agency.</p>
<p>We will explore children’s interactions with institutions of modernity, social constructs and social structures—including age, gender, family, class, community and caste—that often marginalise children in multiple ways. We aim for a convergence of innovative ideas around childhood, recognising that this category is contested and raises important dilemmas for interdisciplinary studies.</p>
<div>
<p>The conference offers a forum within these two days to identify and develop convergences, conflicts, and aspects that may have been overlooked by one discipline, but explored in another. Our inclusion of historical and contemporary scholarly perspectives aims to contextualise and historicise issues. A significant objective of the conference will be to highlight the methodological implications of research into the perspectives and experiences of children.</p>

<p lang="en-US"><span style="font-family: Cambria,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: medium"><b>Venue: </b></span></span><span style="font-family: Cambria,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: medium"><b>Seminar Room A, H.C. Coombs Building (no. 9), ANU</b></span></span></p>
<p lang="en-US"><span style="font-family: Cambria,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: medium">The problem of understanding caste, as I see it, is to pinpoint what is particular to this South Asian mode of stratification, while avoiding an essentialism that isolates caste from other social forms. What I try to do, in a book I am currently finishing, is to place the particularities of caste along transcultural variables. </span></span></p>
<p lang="en-US"><span style="font-family: Cambria,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: medium">Opposing Dumont’s view of the ‘absence of the individual’ in Indian culture, I try to define an Indian concept of the individual, characterized by the purported immunity of the self to the social sphere. Analyzing interaction, I do find actors highly concerned to place themselves in a rank order, even when this order is unlikely to extend beyond the current situation: but, I argue, the relative immunity of the self acts as a shield to keep ranking apart from the self. Indian actors, then, do not try to impose a consistent personality on diverse situations: they demonstrate their social capability by adapting to them. </span></span></p>
<p lang="en-US"><span style="font-family: Cambria,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: medium">Local stratification is seen as expressing power relations, explained by actors in a historical mode, which at once explains high positions and excuses low ones, as if history was an interactional sequence played out between communities rather than individuals. Indigenous models of society provide an alternative and different explanatory mode, as when Brahmins claim the superior position. Such claims are made in terms of holistic models, such as Dumont’s, which corresponds quite well with the Brahmin view. But such models – there is also a king-centered model putting the warrior castes on top, and possibly a merchant-centered model </span></span><span style="font-family: Cambria,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: medium"><b>-</b></span></span><span style="font-family: Cambria,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: medium"> are holistic precisely because they have to include the inferiors. The latter, as Berreman and other scholars point out, have alternative views. I conclude that holistic models, in India but also in the West as the ‘functional theory of stratification’ shows, are constructions of the dominant, and that confusion results when these models are taken to represent ‘Indian culture’. </span></span></p>
<p lang="en-US"><span style="font-family: Cambria,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: medium">Indian society should, I hold, rather be seen as multicultural, with several opposed models used to describe and explain its structure. Still, the tendency to create rank order in so many situations points to particular rules of discourse, which implies talking ‘as if’ hierarchy, in the Dumontian sense, was a real presence.</span></span></p>

The aim of the project is to provide insights into children&#8217;s lives in contemporary India and, more generally, into children’s ways of looking at the world.  The project is based on video workshops conducted over eight to ten-week periods with children in different socio-economic and geographical settings. In the workshops the children, aged between 10 and 13 years, use video cameras to carry out research on topics they have chosen in their immediate communities. As well as making the children&#8217;s films publicly available, the project archives the video material produced as a scholarly resource for future study. The films to be shown are from a workshop conducted in a government primary school in New Delhi in 2012.

<p lang="en-US"><span style="font-family: Cambria,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: medium">One of the most intriguing issues with respect to contemporary Indian education is the continuing appeal of ‘traditional’ Hindu school education in context of the increasingly pervasive forces of ‘modernity’ and globalisation. In Korba, a growing industrial town in central India, these forces are being manifested through the sudden proliferation of computer stores, internet cafes, and combined IT and English ‘tutorial centres’. This phenomenon is occurring in tandem with rising student enrolment in the Hindu Nationalist, Hindi medium </span></span><span style="font-family: Cambria,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: medium"><i>Saraswati Shishu Mandir</i></span></span><span style="font-family: Cambria,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: medium"> school – in spite of the presence of what is locally perceived to be more ‘progressive’, English-medium educational alternatives. Through ethnographic analysis, this paper explores the relationship between these two phenomena. Specific focus is on how, in light of the growing awareness of ‘modernity’ and ‘globalisation’ and accompanying importance being given to computer education and English literacy, preferences for more ‘traditional’, Hindu-based, Hindi-medium education are growing, particularly amongst Korba’s lower classes. Particular attention will be on the perspectives of children and teachers, and how they express and validate their educational choices. The paper also considers the way in which notions of class and status, along with local views about the ‘value’ of discipline, the role of language (English and Hindi), and broader notions of Hindu nationalism, factor into and shape these preferences. </span></span></p>

<p lang="en-US"><span style="font-family: Cambria,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: medium">Throughout its history, anthropology has paid little dedicated attention to children and youth. In recent years, however, there has been a growing theoretical interest in how notions of the ‘child’ and ‘childhood’ are understood cross-culturally, and in children’s and youth’s own perspectives and engagement in their social worlds. In this master class, we examine some of the theoretical antecedents and methodological challenges that are raised in the process of anthropological research with children. What is a ‘child’, and why is a cross-cultural understanding of ‘children’ and ‘childhood’ important? Why should anthropologists be interested in children, and why have they been so reluctant to make them the focus of study? Is it really possible to engage in ‘participant’ observation with children? And what are some of the more effective methodological tools that can be used to ‘get at’ children’s perspectives and ideas during fieldwork? This master class addresses these and other issues that inform anthropological research with children.</span></span></p>

<p>Monday 15/7/13 Time 2-4pm, Venue: Seminar Room A, Coombs bldg</p>
<p>The prerequisite for attending is to read Gupta&#8217;s recent book, &#8220;Red Tape: Bureaucracy, Structural Violence, and Poverty in India&#8221; (Duke, 2012). The book is now available at the ANU library, both in hard copy and as an E-book for easy access, (<a title="http://goo.gl/wy1nF" href="http://goo.gl/wy1nF">http://goo.gl/wy1nF</a>). For an overview of professor Akhil Gupta’s work, see also <a title="http://ucla.academia.edu/AkhilGupta" href="http://ucla.academia.edu/AkhilGupta">http://ucla.academia.edu/AkhilGupta</a>.</p>
<p>The book would be of broad interest to students of Anthropology and South Asia. It engages a wide range of issues around structural violence, forms of inequality, corruption, development, bureaucracy, the anthropology of the state, ethnographic analysis and other anthropological themes. In the Master Class, students will present their own projects, ask questions about how they might apply ideas from the book to their own projects (or ask questions about the book in general), and receive feedback from Professor Gupta about their projects.</p>
<p>As we have limited places, we ask of students to register in advance and commit to reading the book. Those wanting to participate should email Assa.Doron@anu.edu.au, by 1 July 2013. We also ask students to provide a three-four sentence description of their own projects.</p>

<p>Tuesday 16/7/13, Time 6.00-7.30 pm, Venue: Headley Bull Theater 1</p>
<p>This public lecture offers some anthropological reflections on India after liberalization. Despite high growth rates, social tensions seem to be rising in India. Uneven growth has led to increasing disparities between urban and rural areas, and between different regions of the country. I tentatively forward a theory that connects a series of phenomena that have largely been analyzed in isolation: conflicts over land in the urban periphery; an armed uprising in areas of the country inhabited primarily by indigenous groups; a middle-class movement over political corruption; the rise of the service-sector economy; the entrenchment of mass popular democracy and decentralized governance; the increased influence of industrial capitalists on the state; and the renewed investments in welfare programs. I will argue that all these components of India&#8217;s political economy are tightly interconnected, and that understanding these interconnections helps explain why terms such as &#8220;neoliberalism&#8221; and &#8220;market-friendly reforms&#8221; are inadequate descriptors of what is happening in India today.</p>
<p>Professor Gupta will also be conducting a masterclass for PhD students.</p>
