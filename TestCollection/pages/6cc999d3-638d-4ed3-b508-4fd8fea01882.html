<h1>Are you an International Student?</h1>
<p>Go to <a href="http://students.anu.edu.au/fees/international/">Fees and Charges for International Students</a></p>
<h1>Are you a Domestic Student?</h1>
<p>(relevant information displayed below)</p>
<h1>Fees and Contribution Amounts for Domestic Students</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>If you are an Australian Citizen, a New Zealand Citizen, or a Permanent Resident you are&nbsp;considered a domestic student.</p>
<p>The ANU currently offers&nbsp;Commonwealth supported places to all Undergraduate domestic students.&nbsp; At the present time, there are no tuition fee-paying (non-Commonwealth supported) places available to&nbsp;Undergraduate&nbsp;students.&nbsp; Domestic undergraduate students may only be offered a fee paying place in certain circumstances outlined in section 36-30 of the <em>Higher Education Support Act 2003</em>.</p>
<p>Postgraduate and Non-Award students are generally offered&nbsp;tuition fee-paying places.&nbsp; A number of Postgraduate programs are available on a Commonwealth supported basis.&nbsp; Your letter of offer will indicate the type of place you are being offered.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>If your letter of offer does not indicate that you will be a Commonwealth supported student you are liable to pay a tuition fee covering the full cost of your studies</strong>.</p>
<p>Research students at ANU are offered a place under the Research Training Scheme (RTS) where the cost of your tuition is met by the Commonwealth.</p>
<p>It is important that students understand that the contribution amounts and tuition fees published on this website apply to&nbsp;enrolments in&nbsp;the 2013 academic year only. Indicative costs are indicated below, however you are also able to search for fees of individual courses you are enrolled in by going to: <a href="http://studyat.anu.edu.au/fees" target="_blank">http://studyat.anu.edu.au/fees</a></p>
<p>Further information on Student Fees is also available on the Student Fees Office website at: <a href="http://www.anu.edu.au/sas/fees/index.php" target="_blank">http://www.anu.edu.au/sas/fees/index.php </a></p>

</ul>
<h2><a title="CSS" name="CSS"></a>Commonwealth Supported Students</h2>
<p>If you study in a Commonwealth supported place:</p>
<ul>
<li>the Commonwealth contributes to the cost of your courses</li>
<li>you pay a student contribution amount towards the cost of your courses</li>
<li>you may be eligible for HECS-HELP assistance to pay your student contribution.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please note New Zealand Citizens and Permanent Residents are <strong>NOT</strong> eligible for HECS-HELP or FEE-HELP assistance.</p>
<p>Prior to 2005, the contribution amount applicable for Commonwealth supported students was set by the government and the student contribution was consistent for all Australian Universities.</p>
<p>The contribution amounts vary depending on the discipline category of the courses studied and courses are grouped into three bands according to discipline, plus prior to 2013, a category referred to as 'National Priorities'.&nbsp; The government determined what was categorised as National Priorities, which were mathematics, science and statistics.</p>
<h3>Student Contribution Amounts</h3>
<p>The student contribution amounts applicable to each discipline area listed below are dependent upon year of commencement and discipline.&nbsp; The contribution amount is determined for each course you are enrolled in.&nbsp; Contribution bands for each course are available on the individual course descriptions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Students who are considering transferring programs are strongly advised to contact the Fees Office (fees@anu.edu.au) to determine which fees they will be liable for.</strong></p>
<p><strong>It is your responsibility to let us know if you have any prior learning which may affect your fee rate.</strong></p>

<h3>Students commencing a new program in 2013</h3>
<p>On 20th August 2012, the Higher Education Support Amendment (Student Contribution Amounts and Other Measures) Bill 2012, was passed by the Parliament. This Bill changes the eligibility criteria for Commonwealth Supported Places for students commencing a new degree in 2013. From 1st January 2013 onwards, Students living overseas for the entire length of their degree will not be eligible for a Commonwealth Supported Place and must pay the Domestic Tuition rate.</p>
<p>This Bill also changes the maximum Student Contribution Amount charged for students studying Mathematics, Sciences and Statistics units. From 1st January 2013 onwards ALL students studying Maths, Sciences and Statistics will be charged at the same maximum Student Contribution Amount, regardless of their course commencement date.</p>
<p>For further information on these changes please visit the Study Assist Website (<a href="http://www.studyassist.gov.au/">www.studyassist.gov.au</a>)</p>

<p>Notes:</p>
<ol>
<li>For pre-2010 students, the maximum annual student contribution amount that may be charged for Education and Nursing units is $4,696.</li>
<li>From 1 January 2010, the maximum annual student contribution amount for commencing Commonwealth supported students undertaking Education and Nursing units of study has been increased from the 'national priority' rate to the Band 1 rate.</li>
<li>The increased maximum annual student contribution amounts affect only students who commence their course of study at a higher education provider on or after 1 January 2010.</li>
<li>If you are a mathematics, science, education, nursing or midwifery graduate you may be eligible for a HECS-HELP Benefit.</li>
</ol>
<p>Continuing students studying Accounting, Administration, Economics and Commerce will be charged the Band 3 rate regardless of commencing year.</p>
<p><strong>Students commencing a new program in 2013</strong></p>
<p>Eligible students that commence a new program of study at ANU in 2013 will be charged at the scheduled 2013 rate.&nbsp; In 2013 and beyond, the rate will be indexed.&nbsp; The rates for the following year will be published in October of the previous year.</p>
<h3><strong>Contribution amounts per six unit course</strong></h3>
<p>The amount charged at the course level is apportioned on the Equivalent Full-Time Student Load (EFTSL) value of the course.&nbsp; Assuming an EFTSL value of 0.125, the student contribution amounts applicable to each band are:</p>
<p><strong>Commenced 2013 and continuing students</strong></p>
<p>Band 3 &ndash; $9,792 x 0.125 = $1224 (1 six unit course)</p>
<p>Band 2 &ndash; $8,363 x 0.125 = $1045</p>
<p>Band 1 &ndash; $5,868 x 0.125 = $733</p>
<h3>Students commencing a new program in 2012</h3>
<p>Eligible students that commence a new program of study at ANU in 2012 will be charged at the scheduled 2012 rate.&nbsp; In 2013 and beyond, the rate will be indexed.&nbsp; The 2013 rate&nbsp;will be&nbsp;published in October 2012.</p>

<h3>Student Learning Entitlement (SLE)</h3>
<p>All Australian citizens, New Zealand citizens and holders of a Permanent visa are allocated a Student Learning Entitlement. This is measured in equivalent fulltime student load (EFTSL). To be Commonwealth Supported for a course, you must have enough SLE to cover the EFTSL value of the course you intend to undertake.</p>
<p><strong>It is your responsibility to monitor your SLE and ensure you have sufficient SLE to cover your course/s.</strong></p>
<p>Your SLE is made up of ordinary, any additional, and lifelong SLE. Your SLE will be used to undertake study as a <strong>Commonwealth Supported Student.</strong> You may be entitled to further SLE. It is your responsibility to investigate this. Please refer to sections 2.5, 2.6 and 2.7 in the <em>Information for Commonwealth Supported Students</em> booklet 2011. This can be found at the DEEWR website <a href="http://www.goingtouni.gov.au/">www.goingtouni.gov.au</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Once the university is alerted that a student no longer has any SLE they are required cancel your enrolment as a Commonwealth Supported Student.</strong></p>
<p>Students who are cancelled from their Commonwealth Supported place will be enrolled in a Domestic Fee paying place.&nbsp; Eligible students may apply for FEE HELP. Please be aware that there is a 20% loading on top of the tuition fees for undergraduate students.</p>
<p>You can expect that the domestic tuition fees will be greater than the Commonwealth Supported contribution amount.</p>

<h2><a title="DTF" name="DTF"></a>Domestic Tuition Fee Paying Places</h2>
<p>Domestic students in tuition fee paying places are charged tuition fees for the courses they enrol in dependent on the year they commenced their program.</p>
<p>The course tuition fee published on this website applies to an enrolment in the 2012 academic year.&nbsp; Students who commence their program of study in 2012 can determine the tuition fee that will apply if enrolling in the course in a subsequent year, by applying a compounding increase of 5% per annum to the 2012 tuition fee.&nbsp; The annual percentage increase applies for the duration of your program.&nbsp; If for example, you commence the Master of Professional Accounting in 2012 and do not complete or discontinue that program so that your enrolment extends to future academic years, the tuition fee you will pay for each course offered would be dependent on the year you enrol in that course.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The increase of 5% compounding per annum will apply until you complete or discontinue the program of study you commenced in 2012.&nbsp; An approved transfer to another program of study prior to completion is considered a discontinuation.</p>
<h4>Example 1 for Domestic Tuition Fee Paying Places &ndash; Jack commenced his Program in 2010</h4>
<p>Jack commenced a Master of Professional Accounting in 2010.&nbsp; All of Jack's tuition fees for this program are determined by his commencement year.&nbsp; This program could be completed in 2010 if Jack enrolled on a full-time basis, but he works full-time and is studying part time, so expects to complete the program sometime in 2012.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jack has a particular penchant for technology issues in the workplace and would like to undertake course <a href="/courses/INFS8004;details.html">INFS8004</a> (Information Systems Management in Organisations) at some stage during his program as an elective.</p>
<ul>
<li>If Jack enrols in this course in 2010, the tuition fee is $2676.</li>
<li>If Jack enrols in this course in 2011, the tuition fee may increase by up to 5% ie $2676 x 105% = $2808.</li>
<li>If Jack enrols in this course in 2012, the tuition fee may increase by a further 5 % ie $2808 x 105% = $2948.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Example 2 for Domestic Tuition Fee Paying Places &ndash; Jack changes his mind</h4>
<p>Towards the end of 2011, Jack is given a promotion as project manager for the financial systems upgrade in his department.&nbsp; He is keen to impress his employer and enhance his future opportunities in a similar role, so considers a change of career path.&nbsp; As a consequence, he decides to discontinue the Master of Professional Accounting in favour of the Master of Business Information Systems.&nbsp; He applies to the University to transfer his program effective for Semester 1, 2012.</p>
<p>Course <a href="/courses/INFS8004;details.html">INFS8004</a> (Information Systems Management in Organisations) is an elective for this program.&nbsp; However, since Jack has changed his program of study, his commencement year is no longer 2011.&nbsp; His transfer to the Master of Business Information Systems will see him treated as a 2012 commencing student in this program of study.&nbsp; The tuition fee applicable to the 2012 academic year is available in October 2011.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Example 3 for Domestic Tuition Fee Paying Places &ndash; Jack is indecisive</h4>
<p>After 9 months in his new role, Jack decides that his new career is not for him and decides to return to his role as an accountant.&nbsp; He&nbsp;applies to transfer back to the Master of Professional Accounting for 2013.&nbsp; Jack has been lucky enough to choose his enrolments carefully and expects to stay on track to complete the program at the end of 2013 or perhaps half way through 2014.</p>
<p>Because of changes in his employment,&nbsp;Jack did not enrol in as many courses as he would have liked in 2012 and has not yet undertaken course <a href="/courses/INFS8004;details.html">INFS8004</a> (Information Systems Management in Organisations).&nbsp; He thinks it is still a good idea, so plans to enrol in the course in 2013.</p>
<p>Jack had his transfer back to the Master of Professional Accounting approved, however this will see him treated as a 2013 commencing student in this program of study.&nbsp; The tuition fee applicable to the 2013 academic year will be available in October 2012.</p>
<h4>Example 4 for Domestic Tuition Fee Paying Places &ndash; Lucky Jack</h4>
<p>Jack enrols in the early part of 2013 but his partner has the opportunity to work in Thailand for a year or two.&nbsp; Obviously, Jack wants to accompany his partner, but this means he will need to defer his studies in the latter part of 2013 through to late 2014/2015.&nbsp; This means he is unable to complete his program in 2013 and potentially, not until 2014 or 2015.</p>
<p>Jack should apply for approved leave from his program.&nbsp; This does not however, affect his commencement year for the purposes of determining his tuition fee.&nbsp; This will still be 2013, despite the approved leave from study.</p>
<h3>2012 Domestic Tuition Fees</h3>
<p>The tuition fees applicable for undergraduate and postgraduate courses in 2012 are available against the descriptions of each course available at Study@ANU.&nbsp; The applicable fee will correspond to the <strong>year you started your program</strong>.&nbsp; If you are a new student in 2012, this will be 2012.&nbsp; If you are a continuing student, this will be the year you commenced your current program.&nbsp; If you are a continuing student and you are changing your program or starting a new program&nbsp;in 2012, then your commencing year is 2012.</p>

<h2><a title="RESEARCH" name="RESEARCH"></a>Domestic Research Students</h2>
<p>The University currently enrols domestic Research students under the Research Training Scheme (RTS), which is funded by the Commonwealth.&nbsp; RTS funded students are not required to contribute to the cost of their tuition for the duration of their program.&nbsp; In 2012, students who exceed the maximum time for completion of their program under the RTS will be given an exemption scholarship with a $0.00 tuition fee charged.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are no Commonwealth Supported Places applicable to Research Programs in 2012.</p>
<p>A&nbsp;full-time load for all Research Programs equates to 48 progress points per annum or a maximum of 24 progress units per semester.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Equivalent Full Time Student Load (EFTSL) values are calculated with a base of 48 units.&nbsp; For example, a student enrolled for an entire semester on a full-time basis will be enrolled in 24 progress units, equating to 24/48 = 0.5 EFTSL.</p>
