<p>Treatment and prevention of cancer by targeting cancer cell metabolism with dichloroacetate. Dichloroacetate (DCA), an inhibitor of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase, is an old drug that has been used in the treatment of rare metabolic disorders that result in very high levels of lactic acid in the blood.&nbsp; Cancer cells are metabolically quite different to normal cells, and also produce large amounts of lactic acid. DCA has recently been shown to be able to inhibit the growth of several types of cancer cells. We are examining the ability of DCA to inhibit growth of breast cancer cells in vitro and in vivo in animal models.&nbsp; We are also examining the ability of DCA to work in combination with and enhance the effectiveness of other anti-cancer treatments.&nbsp; As DCA is a relatively non-toxic drug, we are also investigating if DCA has the ability to prevent the development of cancer in the p53 deficient mouse model, as this may offer individuals highly susceptible to breast cancer an alternative to radical preventive surgery.</p>

These myopathies are linked to mutations in the ryanodine receptor or its associated proteins that cause malignant hyperthermia, central core disease and myotonic dystrophy in skeletal muscle or cause arrhythmias in the heart that can lead to sudden death. In addition we are exploring age-related changes in the ryanodine receptor protein complex that contribute to muscle weakness in sarcopaenia. Our present focus in all aspects is on two important protein-protein interactions. The first is between the surface membrane dihydropyridine receptor and ryanodine receptor that enables excitation-contraction coupling in skeletal muscle.&nbsp; The second is the regulation of both skeletal and cardiac ryanodine receptors by proteins that bind to it within lumen of the sarcoplasmic reticulum and dictate the way the ion channel responds to the load of Ca<sup>2+</sup> within the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca<sup>2+</sup> store.

<p>The Evolution of Human Diversity and its Impact on Health and Disease. My interests are in how the evolutionary dynamic between humans and their environments has shaped the complexity of human biology, given rise to human diversity and left a lasting impact on our health and wellbeing. I have a particular interest in the role of natural selection in the evolution of differences in personality, cognitive style and social behaviour, its impact on heath, welfare and human potential, and its implications for education, healthcare and the management of organizations and social institutions. Current work in my lab involves analysis of variation at specific genes to identify and characterise both signals of natural selection and associations with personality and behavioural traits, measures of cognitive performance, and health outcomes. The evolutionary analysis is underpinned by a substantial collection of genetic samples from human and other primate species. We are developing and applying new approaches to detecting and measuring the effects of diversifying selection in non-equilibrium populations. Our work on phenotype associations is based on large, longitudinal population-based cohorts with extensive health, life history, psychometric and neuroimaging data. I also work on the contribution of genetic variation to high performance. I plan to extend our previous work on athletic performance to include cognitive and behavioural performance in academic, business and other demanding contexts. The work is carried out in a collaborative environment that includes clinicians, epidemiologists, psychologists, bioinfomaticians and molecular geneticists. I am particularly interested in genes involved in dopamine and serotonin signaling in the brain and hormone receptors, such as the vasopressin, oxytocin and estrogen receptors, with important functions in the central nervous system. Possible projects include: The evolutionary dynamics of genes associated with variation in cognition, personality and behaviour; the role of dopamine receptor variation in clinically identified subtypes of attention deficit hyperactive disorder in adults; the role of genes on late age cognitive decline and brain atrophy; the role of oxytocin and vasopressin receptor variation on social behaviour and behavioural disorders; the role of genes encoding components of the dopamine and serotonin system in anxiety disorders, including post-traumatic stress disorder; genetic variation associated with athletic performance.</p>

We are pursuing this goal using a range of viral (e.g. pox, influenza A and herpes) and animal models. Our studies allow us to dissect the roles of leukocyte subsets, cytokines, antibody and a number of signalling molecules in viral infection and disease. The immune effector mechanisms that are generated to control and clear virus instead often cause immunopathology that has serious, sometimes lethal, consequences for the host. We have therefore directed our research effort toward dissecting out the immunological parameters that allow the rapid resolution of virus infection with minimum pathology. These studies are being carried out in parallel with others that attempt to reveal the many strategies that viruses have evolved to subvert the host immune response. &nbsp;</p>

Translation takes place on the ribosome, and is aided by numerous accessory factors. Control at this post-transcriptional level makes major contributions to gene regulation and its dysregulation is increasingly recognised as an important factor in human disease. Pathologic mechanisms may perturb the activity of components of the translational machinery with a broad impact on the cellular translation program, leading to, for instance, malignant transformation, inappropriate cell death or cardiac hypertrophy. Failure to properly regulate the translation of specific mRNAs is also linked to a growing spectrum of diseases. We investigate post-transcriptional gene control in mammalian and yeast cell culture models and employ a mix of conventional molecular biology approaches as well as global methods such as next generation sequencing.</p>

<p>Since all HIV-1 &ldquo;systemic vaccine trials&rdquo; in humans have elicited poor outcomes, there is now an increased awareness of the potential importance of inducing local antiviral immune responses at &ldquo;mucosal surfaces&rdquo;, particularly in the genital and rectal tissues, the cervico-vaginal tissues in females where the virus is usually first encountered, and in the gastro-intestinal tract, which appears to be a major site of virus replication. It is now widely accepted that, purely systemic immunisation strategies for example; intramuscular, intravenous although inducing good systemic T cell responses rarely induce optimal sustained mucosal T or B cell immunity. It has been shown that a direct mucosal application of a vaccine is necessary to induce sustained mucosal immunity. Furthermore, we have shown that the mucosal vaccination can induce better quality CD8+ T cells (T cells of higher avidity) compared to systemic vaccination. Therefore, in our laboratory we are currently evaluating the efficacy of new-generation of pox virus HIV vaccines that could be delivered intra nasally, orally, and/or systemically, that could enhance the magnitude, cytokine profile as well as the avidity of both mucosal and systemic CD8+ T cells. Several immunological and molecular techniques such as ELISpot, intracellular cytokine staining, tetramer staining and PCR based assays have been developed in our laboratory to assess the immune responses to vaccine antigens. Our laboratory is mainly focused on 1. Evaluating the quality of HIV specific mucosal and systemic T cells generated by prime boost vaccination. In order to achieve this, profiling of mucosal and systemic T cells are being performed in the laboratory. 2. Understanding the molecular mechanisms governing the induction of high avidity CD8+ T cells following mucosal prime boost vaccination. 3. Identifying novel molecules (i.e. cytokines, chemokines) that could be utilised as molecular markers to measure mucosal immune responses to vaccine antigens. 4.

<p>Some infants are born with a segment of blocked gut due to a lack of nerve cells in the gut wall, a condition known as Hirschsprung&rsquo;s disease. Although surgery is a life saving procedure, many patients with Hirschsprung&rsquo;s disease also exhibit profound neurological disorders, including Downs syndrome, congenital central hypoventilation, nerve related deafness, seizures and mental retardation. Our previous study in a rat model of Hirschsprung&rsquo;s disease also showed a marked deficit in nerve cell numbers in part of the brain called the cerebellum. We aim to correct this nerve deficit by transplanting healthy stem cells that can develop into nerve cells and glial cells in the diseased cerebellum. We will isolate stem cells from the cerebellum of normal neonatal rats and genetically label the cells with a green protein. These labelled cells will grow into a ball of cells called neurosphere, which will be transplanted into the diseased cerebellum of rats with Hirschsprung&rsquo;s disease. To allow for the development of neurospheres into functional nerve cells and glial cells, an artificial opening of the gut (stoma) will be created to allow the recipient rats to survive into adulthood. We will analyse the growth and connections made by transplanted cells in the recipient cerebellum using specific labelling techniques, and analyse the restoration of cerebellar functional deficits after stem cell transplantation. The results will provide important information on how the stem cell technique be used for the treatment of brain anomalies in human Hirschsprung&rsquo;s disease.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is now clearly established that the central regulator of eukaryotic gene transcription is the organisation of the genome into chromatin. Chromatin performs this crucial function by partitioning the genome into domains that are either open and transcriptionally active or closed and repressed. Chromatin is built from nucleosomes (histones plus DNA), the universal repeating protein-DNA complex in all eukaryotic cells. Significantly, the tail of each histone protrudes on the outside of the nucleosome and is subject to an extensive range of enzyme-catalysed modifications of site-specific amino acid residues in response to intrinsic and external signals. Functionally, it has been argued that the combination of such modifications is recognised or read by specific chromatin binding proteins involved in regulating transcription and/or chromatin structure. However, our recent work has shown that the functional readout of specific histone modifications is not sufficient to control chromatin function but is also dependent upon the composition of the underlying nucleosome.&nbsp;Studies are aimed at elucidating how the composition of the nucleosome changes to regulate cellular differentiation.</p>

<p>My research has focused on degenerative diseases of the retina, from the molecular and cellular level, to the clinical. This research has had an impact in two particular areas: (1) The role of oxygen levels in the stability and degeneration of photoreceptors; and (2) the retina&#39;s ability to self-protect against stress, using the regulated expression of protective factors. In the former area I was the first to demonstrate the oxygen dependence of several forms of photoreceptor degeneration; in the latter I have shown the sites of trophic factor binding to organelles of the photoreceptor. These lines of research have led to the formulation and testable hypotheses concerning the mechanisms that either damage or protect photoreceptors. Using the light-induced model of retinal degeneration, I was able to test the effects of protective factors and investigate their action mechanism on the stressed retina. To characterise this model further, I started to investigate the role of mitochondrial damage, metabolic changes and oxidative damage in light-induced photoreceptor injury.</p>

<p>Humoral Immunity and Autoimmunity Group We study how microRNA mediated regulation of gene expression in T follicular (TFH) helper cells, prevents the development of autoimmune diseases including lupus, type 1 diabetes and autoimmune arthritis. We take advantage of our discovery of the Roquin tolerance pathway to dissect the contribution of TFH cells and germinal centres to the development of pathogenic autoantibodies and TFH-cell derived lymphomas. &nbsp;</p>

<p>In order to understand the highly complex functions of the brain, we must understand how individual neurons communicate with each other. This communication occurs at specialized synaptic contacts, and the overall aim of the Group is to understand how synaptic strength is regulated, and how synaptic signals are processed by target neurons. &nbsp;</p>
