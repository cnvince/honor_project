<h1>The WEDGE Virtual Reality Theatre</h1>

The <a href="http://www.anu.edu.au/external.html">Australian National University</a> opened the first walk-in virtual reality
theatre in Australia on Friday 3rd April 1998.<p>

The WEDGE is an innovative visualisation system aimed at assisting
researchers in almost every field to make sense of their data.  Today there
is an avalanche of data coming from experiments, scientific computation,
remote sensors and data warehouses.  Researchers can make sense of this
data by standing in the Wedge and seeing a fully 3D interactive image
floating in space in front of them.

The WEDGE also 
has obvious applications in industry, finance and social areas as
well as in remote education.  It has already generated great interest from
local and interstate industry, government and educational institutions.
<p>
The WEDGE is an Australian invention and has been designed and built at the
University.  The software is also locally developed.
<p>
A feature which distinguishes the WEDGE from other virtual environment
systems is the relatively low cost.  The aim has been to
develop a system which is affordable by medium-sized enterprises and
research groups.

The WEDGE has been developed by a joint team from the 
<a href="http://rsphysse.anu.edu.au/prl/">Plasma Research
Laboratory</a>, <a href="http://rsphysse.anu.edu.au/">Research School of 
Physical Sciences and Engineering</a> and the
<a href="http://anusf.anu.edu.au/">ANU Supercomputer Facility's</a>
Visualization Laboratory, <a

<h2>Details Of The Wedge</h2>

<p>
The WEDGE consists of two vertical screens which are back 
projected providing a form of immersive virtual environment. The present 
configuration uses two screens of 1.5m by 1.5m which are elevated about a 
metre from the ground and which meet at a right angle. 
The viewing area is big enough to allow several people 
to view the data at the same time.  Each person wears a light pair of LCD 
shutter glasses (which resemble sunglasses) to allow stereoscopic vision and 
the group leader can use an ultrasonic head mounted tracking 
device to allow different perspectives to be projected automatically. A
remote 3D mouse control is also available.  Underlying the system is
the <a href="http://anusf.anu.edu.au/pSpace">pSpace</a> software.
<p>
In the present installation, the 3D images being projected 
(using NEC MultiSync XG75 projectors)
are generated by an Intergraph TDZ 2000 
graphics-enhanced PC and seem to float 
in the space created by the WEDGE giving a much greater feeling of reality 
than using a single screen. At present we are working on images of 
complicated plasmas used for fusion research, large biologically-important 
molecules, minimum energy surfaces and new systems for data retrieval.
<p>
The WEDGE project was started in December 1996 and was initiated by Drs
<a href="http://rsphysse.anu.edu.au/~rwb112/SP3/Boswell/Boswell.html">Rod 
Boswell</a> and <a href="http://rsphysse.anu.edu.au/~hjg105/henry.html">
Henry Gardner</a>.
<a href="http://anusf.anu.edu.au/~drw900/">Drew Whitehouse</a>
 of the <a href="http://anusf.anu.edu.au/">ANU Supercomputer Facility</a>
  is a key member of the Wedge team and has written 
the software <a href="http://anusf.anu.edu.au/pSpace">pSpace</a> to the theatre as well as much of the application
development and overall system design.

<p>
 Boswell and Gardner were motivated to build a virtual reality system
which would be affordable and appropriate for the typical scientific
applications in Australian Universities and which would be readily
modified as computer and projection technologies change. Much of the
time spent in the planning stages of the theatre was taken up in
trialing different projector and computing systems and in applying for
funding. The actual construction phase of the project lasted about
three months. The supporting aluminium frame was made in the workshops
of the Research School of Physical Sciences and Engineering at ANU.

<h2>Next Generation Wedge</h2>

In December 1998 a new, wide-angle WEDGE theatre was opened at the
Research School of Physical Sciences and Engineering. With each screen
having dimensions of 4m by 2.2m, this "WEDGEORAMA" has the look and
feel of a real theatre and can accommodate about 20 viewers at once.
