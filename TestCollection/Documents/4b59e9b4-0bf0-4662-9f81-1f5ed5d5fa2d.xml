   <string>People often wonder how todays climate compares with detailed climate records from tens of thousands of years ago to tens of millions of years ago. To the best of our knowledge, we have to search back 55 million years to find a time interval where the rate temperature changes were anywhere near the rate of change that is occurring now. This time interval is called the Paleocene- Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM). In this lecture, Dr Bradley Opdyke will compare data from the Eocene to data collected from around Australia in the Late Quaternary (the past half million years). He will finish the lecture with some facts and figures concerning the modern climate and some of the misinformation that has been liberally spread in the public arena.Dr Opdyke graduated from Columbia University with a bachelors degree in Geochemistry in 1984. He then moved to the University of Michigan where he earned a masters degree in Geology in 1987 and a PhD 1990. His areas of study concentrated on marine chemistry (carbonate chemistry) and carbonate rocks. Dr Opdykes research has spanned Paleoceanographic studies from the Cretaceous to the Quaternary. He is also acknowledged to be a global expert on ocean acidification. viewcount:0 Time:null</string>
