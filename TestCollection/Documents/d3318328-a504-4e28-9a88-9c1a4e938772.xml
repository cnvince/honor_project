   <string>Hugh White, Professor of Strategic Studies in the ANU College of Asia and the Pacific outlines the key arguments in his latest book &apos;The China Choice&apos; and why he thinks changing power structures in the Asia Pacific is one of the biggest stories of our time.In 2010 Professor Hugh White released a Quarterly Essay titled &apos;Power Shift&apos;, creating overnight a new debate about China&apos;s rise and Australia&apos;s role in the coming century. This essay continues to shape the debate in both Australia and the Asia-Pacific. Now in 2012, Professor White again asks Australians and Americans to think seriously about their place in the world with the release of his new book &apos;The China Choice: Why America should share power&apos;.Professor White argues the US over the coming decades can either cede Asia to China, try and confront and contain China or, try and find a way to share power with China, so as to avoid a potentially catastrophic war. How America responds, White argues, might be its most important choice this century.For Australia, these choices present difficult challenges at home. How America chooses will shape Australia&apos;s defence policies, alliances, economy and regional relationships. To help explain these challenges, Professor White draws from his experience as a former Deputy Secretary of the Australian Defence Department and Professor of Strategic Studies at ANU. He has served as an intelligence analyst with the Office of National Assessments, as a journalist with the Sydney Morning Herald, as a senior adviser on the staffs of Defence Minister Kim Beazley and Prime Minister Bob Hawke, and as the first Director of the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI).
