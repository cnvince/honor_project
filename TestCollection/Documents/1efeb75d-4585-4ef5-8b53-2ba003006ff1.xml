   <string>The world faces monumental challenges of ensuring energy supply can meet ever growing needs, while urgently reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The current course we are on will see global energy demand rise 45% by 2030, according to the International Energy Agency&apos;s World Energy Outlook 2008. The report also offers this sobering assessment: The world&apos;s energy systems are at a crossroads. Current global trends in energy supply and consumption are patently unsustainable  environmentally, economically, socially.The EU&apos;s indigenous energy supplies fall well short of demand, with over 54% of primary energy consumption currently being imported.The European Union does not underestimate the scale of the task ahead. December 2008 saw the formal adoption of measures to put the EU on a path to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, boost energy efficiency and increase the share of renewables in final energy consumption to 20% by 2020. The objectives also include increasing renewables in transport, to encourage the uptake of biofuels and electric vehicles.In this public lecture, Commissioner Andris Piebalgs, discusses the EU response to its energy security concerns and the threat of climate change.Commissioner Piebalgs became Energy Commissioner in November 2004 and previously headed the Cabinet of Latvian Commissioner.
