He received his Ph.D. in 1993 from Harvard University. His research focuses on theoretical physics and cosmology, especially the origin and constituents of the universe.He has contributed to models of interactions between dark matter, dark energy and ordinary matter; alternative theories of gravity; and violations of fundamental symmetries. Professor Carroll is the author of From Eternity to Here: The Quest for the Ultimate Theory of Time, Spacetime and Geometry: An Introduction to General Relativity, and the forthcoming The Particle at the End of the Universe.
