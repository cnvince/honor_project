   <string>A major workshop was held in the ANU&apos;s College of Asia &amp; the Pacific on 8 Feb 2013, to challenge the highly influential (although controversial) characterisation of the region as an &apos;arc of instability&apos;. This workshop proposes that although challenges remain, it is time to focus on the region&apos;s resilience and potential, instead seeing it as an &apos;arc of opportunity&apos;.The workshop attracted a significant amount of interest, with people from government, the policy community, the media and academia.  One reason that the workshop has attracted so much interest is that it represents a unique attempt to bring together, and encourage dialogue between, two often separate policy and academic communities: security and strategic thinkers on the one hand, development and governance thinkers on the other.  The organisers, Dr Joanne Wallis from the Strategic and Defence Studies Centre, and Dr Sinclair Dinnen from the State, Society and Governance in Melanesia Program, exemplify this effort.  They are hopeful that the workshop will be the first step in an ongoing conversation amongst all communities interested in the region.This panel discussion considers the origins of the term &apos;arc of instability&apos;, how practical the term is and the position Australia could take to engage effectively. viewcount:0 Time:null</string>
