   <string>The 70/7 Series (seventy songs over seven years) represents over 10 years research in the development of a new approach to music in education known as the Music Outreach Principle. The 70/7 series is a base-line approach to music-making at the primary school level under which students learn ten songs for each year of primary school  kindergarten to Year 6. It has been developed in consultation with primary school students and their teachers over ten years.The Series has been developed by the Music Education Program (MEP)  a program run by the The Australian National University&apos;s School of Music and funded by ArtsACT. It will be available to schools on a trial basis as part of its development process. 7/70 was launched with an enthusiastic chorus of song from a kindergarten class at Majura Primary School, members of the ACT community, Dr Susan West of MEP and the head of the ANU School of Music, Professor Adrian Walter. With the inclusion of arts in the new National Curriculum there is a clear need for accessible, tried and tested resources which boost the confidence of teachers to make music in their classrooms with their children, said Dr West.Each set of songs is designed to be taught in five to ten minutes a day across the school year by general primary school classroom teachers, with or without special assistance. There is one principle outcome: that every student leaves school willing and able to sing, in a group and alone, at least 70 songs.For more information: http://music.anu.edu.au/open-school-music/music-education... viewcount:0 Time:null</string>
