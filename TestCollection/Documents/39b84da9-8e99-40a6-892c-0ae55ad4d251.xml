   <string>Emeritus Professor Marian Sawer AO, FASSA presents a public lecture, Feminism for the 21st century, at The Australian National University. Feminism has suffered from &apos;false feminist death syndrome&apos; for almost as long as it has existed. Some believe that now with a woman Prime Minister equality has been &apos;done&apos; in Australia and the time for feminism is over. Examining some of the media representations of feminism over the past century and the rather different story that can be found in the archives reveals a story of feminist persistence in pursuit of goals still far from achieved. An Adjunct Professor in the School of Political Science and International Relations in the ANU College of Arts and Social Sciences, Marian Sawyer is also the former head of the Political Science Program in the ANU Research School of Social Sciences. She has researched and published widely in the fields of democratic theory and practice, electoral administration and gender politics, and has just stepped down as Vice-President of the International Political Science Association. viewcount:0 Time:null</string>
