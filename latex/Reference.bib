@article{Péter2004,
abstract = {This article discusses the concept of federated searching. The words federal and federated do not always conjure up positive images. Still, federated is the most expressive adjective when it comes to the consolidated retrieval of results in response to a query sent to several databases hosted by different online information systems. Federated searching consists of transforming a query and broadcasting it to a group of disparate databases with the appropriate syntax, merging the results collected from the databases, presenting them in a succinct and unified format with minimal duplication, and allowing the library patron to sort the merged result set by various criteria. Large libraries spend more than \$1 million a year for the digital archives of journal publishers, and for abstracting and indexing and full-text databases. Still, few patrons discover these digital sources, and even fewer use them happily and regularly because they are not exposed well on many libraries' home pages. Other drawbacks include different interfaces and search languages, and often their names do not provide enough clues to choose them when looking for information about a topic. The three most popular federated search engines in the U.S. are MuseSearch, Ex Libris' MetaLib, and WebFeat's Prism.},

@article{Lee1997,
abstract = {It has been known that different representations of a query retrieve different sets of documents. Recent work suggests that significant improvements in retrieval performance can be achieved by combining multiple representations of an information need. However, little effort has been made to understand the reason why combining multiple sources of evidence improves retrieval effectiveness. In this paper we analyze why improvements can be achieved with evidence combination, and investigate how evidence should be combined. We describe a rationale for multiple evidence combination, and propose a combining method whose properties coincide wit h the rationale. We also investigate e the effect of using rank instead of similarity on retrieval effectiveness.},
