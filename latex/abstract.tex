Result merging problems have been a significant issues in federated search. However, there exist no general algorithms that can work well in all situations and no particular algorithm can defeat another in every environment. In this paper, we examine several approaches that are widely used in this area. We built a meta-search engine based on the search engines that are distributed among different departments of The Australian National University. Several merging algorithms have been considered their feasibility to fit into the environment and some are implemented as the broker merging function. The algorithms are then be evaluation based on a manually judgement system and NDCG measurement is applied to compare their performance. The result shows that [to be continue]. And then we proposed a [to be continue] algorithm, and experiment shows that[to be continue].
